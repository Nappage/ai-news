  "content": "Metrax is a high-performance JAX-based metrics library developed by Google. It standardizes model evaluation by offering robust, efficient metrics for classification, NLP, and vision, eliminating manual re-implementation after migrating from TensorFlow. Key strengths include parallel computation of \"at K\" metrics (e.g., PrecisionAtK) for multiple K values and strong integration with the JAX AI Stack, leveraging JAX's performance features. It is open-source on GitHub.",
