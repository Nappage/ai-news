New agentic features include `thinking_level` for reasoning control, Stateful Tool Use via Thought Signatures, and `media_resolution` for multimodal fidelity. It has Day 0 support for open-source frameworks like LangChain, AI SDK, LlamaIndex, Pydantic AI, and n8n. Best practices include simplifying prompts and keeping temperature at 1.0.",
