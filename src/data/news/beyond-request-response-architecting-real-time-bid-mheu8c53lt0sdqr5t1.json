It advocates for a real-time bidirectional streaming architecture, implemented by the Agent Development Kit (ADK). This streaming model enables true concurrency, natural interruptibility, and unified multimodal processing. ADK's core features are real-time I/O management, stateful sessions for agent handoffs, and streaming-native tools.",
