It's an AI-first architecture, prioritizing ML matrix engines, and offers a unified developer experience. Designed for ultra-low-power, always-on AI in wearables and IoT, it enables contextual awareness, audio/image processing, and user interaction with hardware-enforced privacy. Synaptics is the first partner to implement Coral NPU.",
