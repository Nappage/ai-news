One engineer reported success using a GPT product to generate some code which he could then correct, but the majority of his job doesn&#x27;t actually involve writing large amounts of new code so the utility is extremely limited. I don&#x27;t know of any other usages of LLM across our teams.<p>I am extremely interested in hearing of success stories from other industries, or conversely I&#x27;d love to hear about what other experiments others have been doing.",
