  "content": "This paper describes our system submitted for SemEval Task 3: Presupposed Taxonomies: Evaluating Neural Network Semantics (Zamparelli et al., 2022). We participated in both the binary classification and the regression subtask. Target sentences are classified according to their taxonomical relation in subtask 1 and according to their acceptability judgment in subtask 2. Our approach in both subtasks is based on a neural network BERT model. We used separate models for the three languages covered by the task, English, French, and Italian. For the second subtask, we used median averaging to construct an ensemble model. We ranked 15th out of 21 groups for subtask 1 (F1-score: 77.38%) and 11th out of 17 groups for subtask 2 (RHO: 0.078).",
