Its &quot;overloaded&quot; - without my money, it wouldn&#x27;t even load - is Anthropic misunderstanding this fact???<p>I&#x27;ll cancel my subscription. I can&#x27;t use Opus 4 without paying either. That&#x27;s such a bad move.<p>What legal options do I have to get my money back or a compensation for not being able to use what I pay for? I&#x27;m really upset on such behavior.<p>I don&#x27;t do Claude Code or do have a large codebase, nor do I feed in image-files or do voice data - I just want it to help me code in my hobby project wit &lt; 2000 lines of python.<p>I hate it!",
