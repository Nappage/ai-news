It treats context as a compiled view over a tiered, stateful system (**Session, Memory, Artifacts**). This architecture uses explicit processors for transformation, enables efficient compaction and caching, and allows for strict, scoped context handoffs in multi-agent workflows to ensure reliability and cost-effectiveness in production.",
