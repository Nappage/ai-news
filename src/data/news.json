      "content": "Hi HN,<p>Happy to share the project I&#x27;ve been vibe-coding on for past few months.\nThe Problem: Like many people, I often found myself staring at a fridge full of random ingredients (some about to expire) with no idea what to cook. I was tired of food waste and the repetitive cycle of making the same few meals. I wanted a way to creatively use what I already had.<p>The Solution: So, I decided to build Chefiniti. It&#x27;s an iOS app that acts as a personal AI chef. The core idea is to turn your available food into delicious, custom recipes. I know there are already tons of apps like it but this one is mine :)<p>Here&#x27;s what it can do:\n* Scan Ingredients: Take photos of your fridge or pantry, and the app&#x27;s vision model identifies the ingredients.\n* &quot;Recipefy&quot; a Dish: See a meal you like online or in a restaurant? Snap a photo, and the app generates a recipe to help you recreate it.\n* Generate from Prompt: Just describe what you&#x27;re in the mood for (e.g., &quot;a spicy, gluten-free pasta dish&quot;), and it will create a recipe from scratch.\n* Import from URL: Paste a link from a recipe website to import it into your cookbook.<p>You can also save all these recipes, create shopping lists, and set detailed preferences for diet, allergies, cuisine, and even the cookware you own.\nApp is in a freemium model, within limits you can really test out core features without any payment or even account creation.<p>The Tech Stack: For those interested, the app is built with:\n* Frontend: React Native (with Expo)\n* Backend: Firebase Functions for the API layer.\n* Database &amp; Storage: Firestore and Firebase Cloud Storage.\n* AI: Google&#x27;s Gemini API for recipe generation and analysis.\n* Image Generation: DeepInfra API (for Stable Diffusion).\n* Subscriptions: RevenueCat.<p>I&#x27;ve just launched on the App Store and would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, thoughts, or questions you might have.<p>You can check it out here: \n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chefiniti.app\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chefiniti.app</a>\nOr download directly\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;chefiniti-smart-recipe-creator&#x2F;id6745801080\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;chefiniti-smart-recipe-creator...</a>\nThanks for taking a look!",

      "content": "I finally got around to making a tool I&#x27;ve wanted for a long time: you can basically think of it as being &quot;like Gmail for coding agents.&quot;<p>If you&#x27;ve ever tried to use a bunch of instances of Claude Code or Codex at once across the same project, you&#x27;ve probably noticed how annoying it can be when they freak out about the other agent changing the files they&#x27;re working on.<p>Then they start doing annoying things, like restoring files from git, in the process wiping out another agent&#x27;s work without a backup.<p>Or if you&#x27;ve tried to have agents coordinate on two separate repos, like a Python backend and a Nextjs frontend for the same project, you may have found yourself acting as the go-between and liaison between two or three different agents, passing messages between them or having them communicate by means of markdown files or some other workaround.<p>I always knew there had to be a better way. But it&#x27;s hard to get the big providers to offer something like that in a way that&#x27;s universal, because Anthropic doesn&#x27;t want to integrate with OpenAI&#x27;s competitive coding tool, and neither wants to deal with Cursor or Gemini-CLI.<p>So a few days ago, I started working on it, and it&#x27;s now ready to share with the world. Introducing the 100% open-source MCP Agent Mail tool. This can be set up very quickly and easily on your machine and automatically detects all the most common coding agents and configures everything for you.<p>I also include a ready-made blurb (see the README file in the repo) that you can add to your existing AGENTS dot md or CLAUDE dot md file to help the agents better leverage the system straight out of the gate.<p>It&#x27;s almost comical how quickly the agents take to this system like a fish to water. They seem to relish in it, sending very detailed messages to each other just like humans do, and start coordinating in a natural, powerful way. They even give each other good ideas and pushback on bad ideas.<p>They can also reserve access to certain files to avoid the &quot;too many cooks&quot; problems associated with having too many agents all working on the same project at the same time, all without dealing with git worktrees and &quot;merge hell.&quot;<p>This also introduces a natural and powerful way to do something I&#x27;ve also long wanted, which is to automatically have multiple different frontier models working together in a collaborative, complementary way without me needing to be in the middle coordinating everything like a parent setting up playdates for their kids.<p>And for the human in the loop, I made a really slick web frontend that you can view and see all the messages your agents are sending each other in a nice, Gmail-like interface, so you can monitor the process. You can even send a special message to some or all your agents as the &quot;Human Overseer&quot; to give them a directive (of course, you can also just type that in manually into each coding agent, too.)<p>I made this for myself and know that I&#x27;m going to be getting a ton of usage out of it going forward. It really lets you unleash a massive number of agents using a bunch of different tools&#x2F;models, and they just naturally coordinate and work with each other without stepping on each other&#x27;s toes. It lets you as the human overseer relax a bit more as you no longer have to be the one responsible for coordinating things, and also because the agents watch each other and push back when they see mistakes and errors happening. Obviously, the greater the variety of models and agent tools you use, the more valuable that emergent peer review process will be.<p>Anyway, give it a try and let me know what you think. I&#x27;m sure there are a bunch of bugs that I&#x27;ll have to iron out over the next couple days, but I&#x27;ve already been productively using it today to work on another project and it is pretty amazingly functional already!",

VaultGemma is available as a pretrained model with 1B parameters that uses a 1024 token sequence length.\r\n\r\nVaultGemma was trained from scratch with sequence-level differential privacy (DP). Its training data includes the same mixture as the [Gemma 2 models](https://huggingface.co/collections/google/gemma-2-release-667d6600fd5220e7b967f315), consisting of a number of documents of varying lengths. Additionally, it is trained using [DP stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00133) and provides a (ε ≤ 2.0, δ ≤ 1.1e-10)-sequence-level DP guarantee, where a sequence consists of 1024 consecutive tokens extracted from heterogeneous data sources. Specifically, the privacy unit of the guarantee is for the sequences after sampling and packing of the mixture.\r\n\r\n* add: differential privacy research model  by @RyanMullins in #40851\r\n\r\n### Qwen3 VL\r\n\r\n<img width=\"3544\" height=\"1886\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5afa70cb-506e-4d56-baa3-30e7522ac653\" />\r\n\r\n[Qwen3-VL](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13923) is a multimodal vision-language model series, encompassing both dense and MoE variants, as well as Instruct and Thinking versions. \r\n\r\nBuilding upon its predecessors, Qwen3-VL delivers significant improvements in visual understanding while maintaining strong pure text capabilities. Key architectural advancements include: enhanced MRope with interleaved layout for better spatial-temporal modeling, DeepStack integration to effectively leverage multi-level features from the Vision Transformer (ViT), and improved video understanding through text-based time alignment—evolving from T-RoPE to text timestamp alignment for more precise temporal grounding. \r\n\r\nThese innovations collectively enable Qwen3-VL to achieve superior performance in complex multimodal tasks.\r\n\r\n* Adding Support for Qwen3-VL Series  by @JJJYmmm in #40795\r\n\r\n### Longcat Flash\r\n\r\n<img width=\"763\" height=\"468\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/289d33e0-6c71-458d-ae07-b7d454ac2adf\" />\r\n\r\nThe LongCatFlash model was proposed in [LongCat-Flash Technical Report](https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.01322) by the Meituan LongCat Team. LongCat-Flash is a 560B parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model that activates 18.6B-31.3B parameters dynamically (average ~27B). The model features a shortcut-connected architecture enabling high inference speed (>100 tokens/second) and advanced reasoning capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe abstract from the paper is the following:\r\n\r\n*We present LongCat-Flash, a 560 billion parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model featuring a dynamic computation mechanism that activates 18.6B-31.3B parameters based on context (average ~27B).

FlexOlmo employs a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture where each expert is trained independently on closed datasets and later integrated through a new domain-informed routing without any joint training. FlexOlmo is trained on FlexMix, a corpus we curate comprising publicly available datasets alongside seven domain-specific sets, representing realistic approximations of closed sets. \r\n\r\nYou can find all the original FlexOlmo checkpoints under the [FlexOlmo](https://huggingface.co/collections/allenai/flexolmo-68471177a386b6e20a54c55f) collection.\r\n\r\n* Add FlexOlmo model  by @2015aroras in #40921\r\n\r\n### LFM2 VL\r\n\r\n<img width=\"2300\" height=\"1400\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef0605cd-9512-458c-915a-62316e14d90c\" />\r\n\r\n[LFM2-VL](https://www.liquid.ai/blog/lfm2-vl-efficient-vision-language-models) first series of vision-language foundation models developed by [Liquid AI](https://liquid.ai/). These multimodal models are designed for low-latency and device-aware deployment. LFM2-VL extends the LFM2 family of open-weight Liquid Foundation Models (LFMs) into the vision-language space, supporting both text and image inputs with variable resolutions.\r\n\r\n#### Architecture\r\n\r\nLFM2-VL consists of three main components: a language model backbone, a vision encoder, and a multimodal projector. LFM2-VL builds upon the LFM2 backbone, inheriting from either LFM2-1.2B (for LFM2-VL-1.6B) or LFM2-350M (for LFM2-VL-450M). For the vision tower, LFM2-VL uses SigLIP2 NaFlex encoders to convert input images into token sequences. Two variants are implemented:\r\n* Shape-optimized (400M) for more fine-grained vision capabilities for LFM2-VL-1.6B\r\n* Base (86M) for fast image processing for LFM2-VL-450M\r\n\r\nThe encoder processes images at their native resolution up to 512×512 pixels, efficiently handling smaller images without upscaling and supporting non-standard aspect ratios without distortion. Larger images are split into non-overlapping square patches of 512×512 each, preserving detail. In LFM2-VL-1.6B, the model also receives a thumbnail (a small, downscaled version of the original image capturing the overall scene) to enhance global context understanding and alignment. Special tokens mark each patch’s position and indicate the thumbnail’s start. The multimodal connector is a 2-layer MLP connector with pixel unshuffle to reduce image token count. \r\n\r\n* Add new model LFM2-VL  by @zucchini-nlp in #40624\r\n\r\n### BLT\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1448\" height=\"1062\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af1fbb09-082c-4331-9217-357adb506cbf\" />\r\n\r\nThe BLT model was proposed in [Byte Latent Transformer: Patches Scale Better Than Tokens](<https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09871>) by Artidoro Pagnoni, Ram Pasunuru, Pedro Rodriguez, John Nguyen, Benjamin Muller, Margaret Li1, Chunting Zhou, Lili Yu, Jason Weston, Luke Zettlemoyer, Gargi Ghosh, Mike Lewis, Ari Holtzman†, Srinivasan Iyer.\r\nBLT is a byte-level LLM that achieves tokenization-level performance through entropy-based dynamic patching.\r\n\r\nThe abstract from the paper is the following:\r\n\r\n*We introduce the Byte Latent Transformer (BLT), a new byte-level LLM architecture that, for the first time, matches tokenization-based LLM performance at scale with significant improvements in inference\r\nefficiency and robustness. BLT encodes bytes into dynamically sized patches, which serve as the primary units of computation. Patches are segmented based on the entropy of the next byte, allocating\r\nmore compute and model capacity where increased data complexity demands it. We present the first flop controlled scaling study of byte-level models up to 8B parameters and 4T training bytes. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of scaling models trained on raw bytes without a fixed vocabulary. Both training and inference efficiency improve due to dynamically selecting long patches when data is predictable, along with qualitative improvements on reasoning and long tail generalization. Overall, for fixed inference costs, BLT shows significantly better scaling than tokenization-based models, by simultaneously growing both patch and model size.*\r\n\r\n#### Usage Tips:\r\n\r\n- **Dual Model Architecture**: BLT consists of two separate trained models:\r\n  - **Patcher (Entropy Model)**: A smaller transformer model that predicts byte-level entropy to determine patch boundaries and segment input.\r\n  - **Main Transformer Model**: The primary model that processes the patches through a Local Encoder, Global Transformer, and Local Decoder.\r\n\r\n- **Dynamic Patching**: The model uses entropy-based dynamic patching where:\r\n  - High-entropy regions (complex data) get shorter patches with more computational attention\r\n  - Low-entropy regions (predictable data) get longer patches for efficiency\r\n  - This allows the model to allocate compute resources where they're most needed\r\n\r\n- **Local Encoder**: Processes byte sequences with cross-attention to patch embeddings\r\n- **Global Transformer**: Processes patch-level representations with full attention across patches\r\n- **Local Decoder**: Generates output with cross-attention back to the original byte sequence\r\n\r\n- **Byte-Level Tokenizer**: Unlike traditional tokenizers that use learned vocabularies, BLT's tokenizer simply converts text to UTF-8 bytes and maps each byte to a token ID. There is no need for a vocabulary.\r\n\r\n* blt wip  by @itazap in #38579\r\n\r\n### Qwen3 Omni MoE\r\n\r\n<img width=\"14084\" height=\"7429\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20d46a43-15f2-42bf-9703-9575f5ca4430\" />\r\n\r\nThe [Qwen2.5-Omni](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-omni/) model is a unified multiple modalities model proposed in [Qwen2.5-Omni Technical Report](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.20215) from Qwen team, Alibaba Group.\r\n\r\n#### Notes\r\n\r\n- Use [`Qwen2_5OmniForConditionalGeneration`] to generate audio and text output. To generate only one output type, use [`Qwen2_5OmniThinkerForConditionalGeneration`] for text-only and [`Qwen2_5OmniTalkersForConditionalGeneration`] for audio-only outputs.\r\n- Audio generation with [`Qwen2_5OmniForConditionalGeneration`] supports only single batch size at the moment.\r\n- In case out out-of-memory errors hwen working with video input, decrease `processor.max_pixels`. By default the maximum is set to a very arge value and high resolution visuals will not be resized, unless resolution exceeds `processor.max_pixels`.\r\n- The processor has its own [`~ProcessorMixin.apply_chat_template`] method to convert chat messages to model inputs.\r\n\r\n* Adding support for Qwen3Omni  by @BakerBunker in #41025\r\n\r\n### Parakeet\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1431\" height=\"527\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e831f451-9be3-4b5c-a222-b833a50ceb2a\" />\r\n\r\nParakeet models, [introduced by NVIDIA NeMo](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/pushing-the-boundaries-of-speech-recognition-with-nemo-parakeet-asr-models/), are models that combine a [Fast Conformer](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/nemotoolkit/asr/models.html#fast-conformer) encoder with connectionist temporal classification (CTC), recurrent neural network transducer (RNNT) or token and duration transducer (TDT) decoder for automatic speech recognition.\r\n\r\n**Model Architecture**\r\n- **Fast Conformer Encoder**: A linearly scalable Conformer architecture that processes mel-spectrogram features and reduces sequence length through subsampling. This is more efficient version of the Conformer Encoder found in [FastSpeech2Conformer](./fastspeech2_conformer.md) (see [`ParakeetEncoder`] for the encoder implementation and details).\r\n- [**ParakeetForCTC**](#parakeetforctc): a Fast Conformer Encoder + a CTC decoder\r\n    - **CTC Decoder**: Simple but effective decoder consisting of:\r\n        - 1D convolution projection from encoder hidden size to vocabulary size (for optimal NeMo compatibility).\r\n        - CTC loss computation for training.\r\n        - Greedy CTC decoding for inference.\r\n\r\n* Add Parakeet  by @nithinraok in #39062\r\n\r\n### EdgeTAM\r\n\r\n<img width=\"949\" height=\"537\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ca4e73d-5aa9-487d-96e1-92d4f2f4739f\" />\r\n\r\nThe EdgeTAM model was proposed in [EdgeTAM: On-Device Track Anything Model](https://huggingface.co/papers/2501.07256) Chong Zhou, Chenchen Zhu, Yunyang Xiong, Saksham Suri, Fanyi Xiao, Lemeng Wu, Raghuraman Krishnamoorthi, Bo Dai, Chen Change Loy, Vikas Chandra, Bilge Soran.\r\n\r\nEdgeTAM is an efficient adaptation of SAM 2 that introduces a 2D Spatial Perceiver architecture to optimize memory attention mechanisms for real-time video segmentation on mobile devices.\r\n\r\n* Add EdgeTAM  by @yonigozlan in #39800\r\n\r\n### OLMO3\r\n\r\nMore details to come soon :eyes:\r\n\r\n* Add Olmo3 model  by @2015aroras in #40778\r\n\r\n## Continuous batching\r\n\r\nWe are introducing Continuous Batching (CB) in this release, we consider it a stable feature. The main use case for CB is batched generation, which makes it very efficient in the context of GRPO training or evaluation. Thanks to CB, researchers or model developers are now free to use transformers in these contexts without having to spin up an additional inference engine. \r\n\r\nCB currently supports both full attention and sliding window attention: this means that the vast majority of models are supported, like llama, gemma3, gpt-oss. \r\n\r\nCB is also integrated with transformers serve, which means that you can deploy transformers as an OpenAI-compatible HTTP server.\r\nHere is a small snippet on how to use it:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport datasets\r\nimport torch\r\n\r\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\r\nfrom transformers.generation import GenerationConfig\r\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\r\n    \"Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507\", dtype=torch.bfloat16, _attn_implementation=\"sdpa_paged\", device_map=\"auto\"\r\n)\r\nmodel.generation_config.max_new_tokens = 32\r\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507\", padding_side=\"left\")\r\ndataset = datasets.load_dataset(\"openai/gsm8k\", \"socratic\", split=\"test\")\r\ntokenized_datasets = dataset.map(lambda x: tokenizer(x[\"question\"]), batched=True)\r\nsimple_batch_inputs = [item[\"input_ids\"] for item in tokenized_datasets]\r\n\r\nbatch_outputs = model.generate_batch(inputs=simple_batch_inputs)\r\nfor request in batch_outputs:\r\n    print(tokenizer.decode(batch_outputs[request].generated_tokens))\r\n\"\"\"\r\n Let's break down the problem

      "content": "Hi, We’ve built Pantheon-CLI, an fully open-source project that aims to be the “Python Claude Code + Notebook” — but designed for data analysis instead of just coding.<p>Unlike most AI coding assistants, Pantheon-CLI runs entirely on your machine (or server). No data upload required. It blends natural language and code in a single workflow, keeping variables in memory and letting you switch seamlessly between typing code and asking in plain English.<p>What it does:\n1. Chat with your data: Directly process CSV, Excel, AnnData, Pickle, Torch tensors, or any format supported by Python&#x2F;R&#x2F;Julia.\n2. Mixed programming: Variables persist across natural language and code; the CLI auto-generates and runs code for you.\n3. MCP-like agent integration: Read&#x2F;create files, run commands, fetch web pages, generate&#x2F;revise code.\n4. Human-like learning: Feed it a PDF paper or tutorial—Pantheon-CLI reads it, plans steps, and replicates methods before analysis.\n5. Task planning: Builds scientific agents by learning from papers&#x2F;tutorials (not just fixed, human-predefined steps).\n6. Multi-model support: Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, DeepSeek, Qwen, etc. + offline local LLMs (ollama, deepseek, gpt-oss).\n7. Multi-RAG support: Pre-learns from docs&#x2F;web into a local “brain” for more credible outputs without massive token costs.\n8. Built-in biology toolsets: For omics analysis (alignment, annotation, differential expression, full paper reproduction).\n9. Notebook mode: Brings the same agentic workflow into Jupyter—automatically runs and revises code, operates on files, and learns from tutorials&#x2F;papers.<p>Pantheon-CLI is our attempt to push beyond “AI writes code for you.” Instead, it’s an agentic operating system for data analysis, spanning both terminal and notebook.<p>Repo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aristoteleo&#x2F;pantheon-cli\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aristoteleo&#x2F;pantheon-cli</a><p>Tutorial: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pantheonos.stanford.edu&#x2F;cli&#x2F;docs&#x2F;intro&#x2F;getting-started\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pantheonos.stanford.edu&#x2F;cli&#x2F;docs&#x2F;intro&#x2F;getting-start...</a><p>Home page: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pantheonos.stanford.edu&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pantheonos.stanford.edu&#x2F;</a><p>Would love to hear feedback from the HN community—what use cases would you try this for, and what features would make it more useful to you?",
