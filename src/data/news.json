One of its best features is the ability to sync your usage across devices, giving you a complete picture over different time periods. It respects your privacy by only collecting aggregated usage data. No conversation or code details are ever touched.<p>There has been some controversy around tracking usage and whether it might lead to price hikes or limits, but honestly, Anthropic probably already knows this data. The app is more about helping you optimise your workflow, not exposing anything sensitive. It also includes a ranking system so you can get a sense of how others are using Claude Code and maybe learn from their patterns.<p>I built it with a solid backend architecture to be scalable and responsive, running on a small Kubernetes cluster.

      "content": "Hi HN,<p>Happy to share the project I&#x27;ve been vibe-coding on for past few months.\nThe Problem: Like many people, I often found myself staring at a fridge full of random ingredients (some about to expire) with no idea what to cook. I was tired of food waste and the repetitive cycle of making the same few meals. I wanted a way to creatively use what I already had.<p>The Solution: So, I decided to build Chefiniti. It&#x27;s an iOS app that acts as a personal AI chef. The core idea is to turn your available food into delicious, custom recipes. I know there are already tons of apps like it but this one is mine :)<p>Here&#x27;s what it can do:\n* Scan Ingredients: Take photos of your fridge or pantry, and the app&#x27;s vision model identifies the ingredients.\n* &quot;Recipefy&quot; a Dish: See a meal you like online or in a restaurant? Snap a photo, and the app generates a recipe to help you recreate it.\n* Generate from Prompt: Just describe what you&#x27;re in the mood for (e.g., &quot;a spicy, gluten-free pasta dish&quot;), and it will create a recipe from scratch.\n* Import from URL: Paste a link from a recipe website to import it into your cookbook.<p>You can also save all these recipes, create shopping lists, and set detailed preferences for diet, allergies, cuisine, and even the cookware you own.\nApp is in a freemium model, within limits you can really test out core features without any payment or even account creation.<p>The Tech Stack: For those interested, the app is built with:\n* Frontend: React Native (with Expo)\n* Backend: Firebase Functions for the API layer.\n* Database &amp; Storage: Firestore and Firebase Cloud Storage.\n* AI: Google&#x27;s Gemini API for recipe generation and analysis.\n* Image Generation: DeepInfra API (for Stable Diffusion).\n* Subscriptions: RevenueCat.<p>I&#x27;ve just launched on the App Store and would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, thoughts, or questions you might have.<p>You can check it out here: \n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chefiniti.app\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chefiniti.app</a>\nOr download directly\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;chefiniti-smart-recipe-creator&#x2F;id6745801080\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;chefiniti-smart-recipe-creator...</a>\nThanks for taking a look!",

This tag is a tagged version of the `main` branch and does not follow semantic versioning. This model will be included in the next minor release: `v4.57.0`.\r\n\r\n## Embedding-Gemma\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1048\" height=\"548\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f40f9dc-353b-472e-8914-2dbf02709ffb\" />\r\n\r\nToday, Google releases EmbeddingGemma, a state-of-the-art multilingual embedding model perfect for on-device use cases. Designed for speed and efficiency, the model features a compact size of 308M parameters and a 2K context window, unlocking new possibilities for mobile RAG pipelines, agents, and more. EmbeddingGemma is trained to support over 100 languages and is the highest-ranking text-only multilingual embedding model under 500M on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) at the time of writing.\r\n\r\n## Usage example\r\n\r\nEmbeddingGemma can be found on the [Huggingface Hub](https://huggingface.co/models?other=gemma3_text). It is integrated in `sentence-transformers` which depends on `transformers`.\r\n\r\nSee below for `sentence-transformers` examples using the model:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\r\n\r\n# Download from the 🤗 Hub\r\nmodel = SentenceTransformer(\"google/embeddinggemma-300m\")\r\n\r\n# Run inference with queries and documents\r\nquery = \"Which planet is known as the Red Planet?\"\r\ndocuments = [\r\n    \"Venus is often called Earth's twin because of its similar size and proximity.\",\r\n    \"Mars, known for its reddish appearance, is often referred to as the Red Planet.\",\r\n    \"Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, has a prominent red spot.\",\r\n    \"Saturn, famous for its rings, is sometimes mistaken for the Red Planet.\"\r\n]\r\nquery_embeddings = model.encode_query(query)\r\ndocument_embeddings = model.encode_document(documents)\r\nprint(query_embeddings.shape, document_embeddings.shape)\r\n# (768,) (4, 768)\r\n\r\n# Compute similarities to determine a ranking\r\nsimilarities = model.similarity(query_embeddings, document_embeddings)\r\nprint(similarities)\r\n# tensor([[0.3011, 0.6359, 0.4930, 0.4889]])\r\n\r\n# Convert similarities to a ranking\r\nranking = similarities.argsort(descending=True)[0]\r\nprint(ranking)\r\n# tensor([1, 2, 3, 0])\r\n```",

      "content": "Hi, We’ve built Pantheon-CLI, an fully open-source project that aims to be the “Python Claude Code + Notebook” — but designed for data analysis instead of just coding.<p>Unlike most AI coding assistants, Pantheon-CLI runs entirely on your machine (or server). No data upload required. It blends natural language and code in a single workflow, keeping variables in memory and letting you switch seamlessly between typing code and asking in plain English.<p>What it does:\n1. Chat with your data: Directly process CSV, Excel, AnnData, Pickle, Torch tensors, or any format supported by Python&#x2F;R&#x2F;Julia.\n2. Mixed programming: Variables persist across natural language and code; the CLI auto-generates and runs code for you.\n3. MCP-like agent integration: Read&#x2F;create files, run commands, fetch web pages, generate&#x2F;revise code.\n4. Human-like learning: Feed it a PDF paper or tutorial—Pantheon-CLI reads it, plans steps, and replicates methods before analysis.\n5. Task planning: Builds scientific agents by learning from papers&#x2F;tutorials (not just fixed, human-predefined steps).\n6. Multi-model support: Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, DeepSeek, Qwen, etc. + offline local LLMs (ollama, deepseek, gpt-oss).\n7. Multi-RAG support: Pre-learns from docs&#x2F;web into a local “brain” for more credible outputs without massive token costs.\n8. Built-in biology toolsets: For omics analysis (alignment, annotation, differential expression, full paper reproduction).\n9. Notebook mode: Brings the same agentic workflow into Jupyter—automatically runs and revises code, operates on files, and learns from tutorials&#x2F;papers.<p>Pantheon-CLI is our attempt to push beyond “AI writes code for you.” Instead, it’s an agentic operating system for data analysis, spanning both terminal and notebook.<p>Repo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aristoteleo&#x2F;pantheon-cli\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aristoteleo&#x2F;pantheon-cli</a><p>Tutorial: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pantheonos.stanford.edu&#x2F;cli&#x2F;docs&#x2F;intro&#x2F;getting-started\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pantheonos.stanford.edu&#x2F;cli&#x2F;docs&#x2F;intro&#x2F;getting-start...</a><p>Home page: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pantheonos.stanford.edu&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pantheonos.stanford.edu&#x2F;</a><p>Would love to hear feedback from the HN community—what use cases would you try this for, and what features would make it more useful to you?",
