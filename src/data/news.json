      "content": "Hi HN,<p>Happy to share the project I&#x27;ve been vibe-coding on for past few months.\nThe Problem: Like many people, I often found myself staring at a fridge full of random ingredients (some about to expire) with no idea what to cook. I was tired of food waste and the repetitive cycle of making the same few meals. I wanted a way to creatively use what I already had.<p>The Solution: So, I decided to build Chefiniti. It&#x27;s an iOS app that acts as a personal AI chef. The core idea is to turn your available food into delicious, custom recipes. I know there are already tons of apps like it but this one is mine :)<p>Here&#x27;s what it can do:\n* Scan Ingredients: Take photos of your fridge or pantry, and the app&#x27;s vision model identifies the ingredients.\n* &quot;Recipefy&quot; a Dish: See a meal you like online or in a restaurant? Snap a photo, and the app generates a recipe to help you recreate it.\n* Generate from Prompt: Just describe what you&#x27;re in the mood for (e.g., &quot;a spicy, gluten-free pasta dish&quot;), and it will create a recipe from scratch.\n* Import from URL: Paste a link from a recipe website to import it into your cookbook.<p>You can also save all these recipes, create shopping lists, and set detailed preferences for diet, allergies, cuisine, and even the cookware you own.\nApp is in a freemium model, within limits you can really test out core features without any payment or even account creation.<p>The Tech Stack: For those interested, the app is built with:\n* Frontend: React Native (with Expo)\n* Backend: Firebase Functions for the API layer.\n* Database &amp; Storage: Firestore and Firebase Cloud Storage.\n* AI: Google&#x27;s Gemini API for recipe generation and analysis.\n* Image Generation: DeepInfra API (for Stable Diffusion).\n* Subscriptions: RevenueCat.<p>I&#x27;ve just launched on the App Store and would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, thoughts, or questions you might have.<p>You can check it out here: \n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chefiniti.app\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chefiniti.app</a>\nOr download directly\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;chefiniti-smart-recipe-creator&#x2F;id6745801080\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;chefiniti-smart-recipe-creator...</a>\nThanks for taking a look!",

Unlike the offline [Voxtral](./voxtral) model which processes complete audio files, VoxtralRealtime is architected for low-latency, incremental transcription by processing audio in chunks as they arrive.\r\n\r\nThe model combines an audio encoder with a Mistral-based language model decoder, using time conditioning embeddings and causal convolutions with padding caches to enable efficient streaming inference.\r\n\r\n* Add Voxtral Realtime (#43769) by @eustlb\r\n\r\n### GLM-5 - GlmMoeDsa\r\n\r\n<img width=\"947\" height=\"638\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c4fff37-7f40-4e86-b4a0-db718f45c93b\" />\r\n\r\nThe zAI team launches GLM-5, and introduces it as such:\r\n\r\n> GLM-5, targeting complex systems engineering and long-horizon agentic tasks. Scaling is still one of the most important ways to improve the intelligence efficiency of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Compared to GLM-4.5, GLM-5 scales from 355B parameters (32B active) to 744B parameters (40B active), and increases pre-training data from 23T to 28.5T tokens. GLM-5 also integrates DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA), largely reducing deployment cost while preserving long-context capacity.\r\n> \r\n> Reinforcement learning aims to bridge the gap between competence and excellence in pre-trained models. However, deploying it at scale for LLMs is a challenge due to the RL training inefficiency. To this end, we developed [slime](https://github.com/THUDM/slime), a novel asynchronous RL infrastructure that substantially improves training throughput and efficiency, enabling more fine-grained post-training iterations. With advances in both pre-training and post-training, GLM-5 delivers significant improvement compared to GLM-4.7 across a wide range of academic benchmarks and achieves best-in-class performance among all open-source models in the world on reasoning, coding, and agentic tasks, closing the gap with frontier models.\r\n\r\n* Add GlmMoeDsa (#43858) by @Cyrilvallez\r\n\r\n### Qwen3.5, Qwen3.5 Moe\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b56dcaca-80e7-4b22-80a5-2f767bb65095\" />\r\n\r\nThe Qwen team launches Qwen 3.5, and introduces it as such:\r\n\r\n> We are delighted to announce the official release of Qwen3.5, introducing the open-weight of the first model in the Qwen3.5 series, namely Qwen3.5-397B-A17B. As a native vision-language model, Qwen3.5-397B-A17B demonstrates outstanding results across a full range of benchmark evaluations, including reasoning, coding, agent capabilities, and multimodal understanding, empowering developers and enterprises to achieve significantly greater productivity. Built on an innovative hybrid architecture that fuses linear attention (via Gated Delta Networks) with a sparse mixture-of-experts, the model attains remarkable inference efficiency: although it comprises 397 billion total parameters, just 17 billion are activated per forward pass, optimizing both speed and cost without sacrificing capability. We have also expanded our language and dialect support from 119 to 201, providing broader accessibility and enhanced support to users around the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Adding Support for Qwen3.5 (#43830) by @bozheng-hit\r\n\r\n### VibeVoice Acoustic Tokenizer\r\n\r\n<img width=\"821\" height=\"349\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1433597-b43b-4d2d-a2c7-216d7792b8c9\" />\r\n\r\n[VibeVoice](https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.19205) is a novel framework for synthesizing high-fidelity, long-form speech with multiple speakers by employing a next-token diffusion approach within a Large Language Model (LLM) structure. It's designed to capture the authentic conversational \"vibe\" and is particularly suited for generating audio content like podcasts and multi-participant audiobooks.\r\n\r\nOne key feature of VibeVoice is the use of two continuous audio tokenizers, one for extracting acoustic features and another for semantic features.\r\n\r\n* Add VibeVoice Acoustic Tokenizer (#43400) by @ebezzam\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n\r\n* :rotating_light: [`Attn`] New attn mask interface everywhere (#42848)\r\n* :rotating_light: Modify ModernBERT's default attention implementation to stop using FA (#43764)\r\n\r\n:rotating_light: This one is quite breaking for super super super old modles: :rotating_light: :rotating_light: \r\n* fix: Prevent AutoTokenizer type mismatch from directory name substrin… (#43791) \r\nIf the config does not have a model-type field, we no longer check the name of the folder like for https://huggingface.co/prajjwal1/bert-tiny/blob/main/config.json\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes and improvements\r\n\r\n* [docs] deploying (#43241) by @stevhliu\r\n* [Trainer] Move NEFTune impl to standalone functions (#43714) by @SunMarc\r\n* Fix `convert_rope_params_to_dict` so it uses `rope_theta` from the config (#43766) by @hmellor\r\n* Bump dev version (#43777) by @qgallouedec\r\n* Improved `AGENTS.md` (#43763) by @tarekziade\r\n* Fix-release-ubild (#43773) by @ArthurZucker\r\n* unpin torch for CircleCI (#43790) by @ydshieh\r\n* [`Modular Dependencies`] Fixup qwen rms norms (#43772) by @vasqu\r\n* fix(testing): Fix BLOOM tokenizer, CLAP audio features, and CLVP text tester usage in tests (#43798) by @harshaljanjani\r\n* Remove unconditional train_batch_size assignment (#43770) by @lordaarush\r\n* [`Repo Consistency`] Fix rms norm (#43803) by @vasqu\r\n* fix: Prevent AutoTokenizer type mismatch from directory name substrin… (#43791) by @tarekziade\r\n* Refactor trainer data_collator and callbacks tests (#43776) by @SunMarc\r\n* [core] Faster and thread-safe `check_model_inputs` implementation (#43765) by @Cyrilvallez\r\n* [Trainer] use deepspeed SP process group when Accelerate doesn’t build a mesh (#43799) by @kashif\r\n* fix(flaky): enforce manual seed to reduce flakiness (#43794) by @tarekziade\r\n* Add TRL CI bot workflow to trigger tests on PR comments (#43809) by @qgallouedec\r\n* Fix DeepSpeed model preparation logic in Trainer class (#43780) by @qgallouedec\r\n* [docs] reveal more in toctree (#43808) by @stevhliu\r\n* Fix markdown documentation (#43076) by @cyyever\r\n* Fix slack-report workflow file (#43851) by @ydshieh\r\n* add `do_sample=False` to qwen2_5_vl model tests to stablize the output (#43728) by @kaixuanliu\r\n* Fix incorrect timestamp calculation in Qwen3VL Processor (#43659) by @jonathan-fulton\r\n* Remove GPU tracking from TrackioCallback and remove env var support (#43371) by @qgallouedec\r\n* Add id and resume support to SwanLab integration (#43719) by @i-pj\r\n* fix gptoss crash in tp (#43853) by @sywangyi\r\n* Delete batch_split from EncoderDecoderCache (#43814) by @cyyever\r\n* delete unnecessary code to make moe compatible to full graph compile (#43855) by @kaixuanliu\r\n* Update ModelType for Unigram tokenizer (#43860) by @pavel-esir\r\n* [docs] Remove pipeline() examples from summarization/translation tasks (#43831) by @Mr-Neutr0n\r\n* Fix video interpolation in pe_audio_video (#43811) by @Rocketknight1\r\n* Look for the pad_token_id in the right place for Llama4 (#43539) by @Rocketknight1\r\n* Fix cardinality error for DETR models without explicit background class (#43513) by @heathdutton\r\n* docs: Add Switch Transformers docstring notes and update spectrogram comment (#43336) by @harshaljanjani\r\n* [xLSTM] Fix bugs preventing small model training (#43209) by @Anri-Lombard\r\n* docs: correct typo 'neccessary' to 'necessary' (#43868) by @thecaptain789\r\n* Improve PR comment CI feedback  (#43852) by @ydshieh\r\n* Fix init weights in remote code (#43768) by @zucchini-nlp\r\n* Fix GlmMoeDsaConfig default mlp_layer_types in modular conversion (#43876) by @OiPunk\r\n* [MistralCommonBackend] fix loading proc (#43887) by @eustlb\r\n* [`Jamba`] Fallback to slow path and warn instead of error out (#43889) by @vasqu\r\n* Fix SwanLab callback to forward resume init args (#43848) by @OiPunk\r\n* Fix old tech stack in doc (#43879) by @cyyever\r\n* Update TrainingArguments (#43806) by @SunMarc\r\n* Remove unnecessary code or checks for PT 2.4+ (#43787) by @cyyever\r\n* Make it possible to evaluate when using sequence parallel in HF Trainer (#43517) by @jp1924\r\n* [Trainer] Move optimizer cls init to trainer_optimizer.py (#43738) by @SunMarc\r\n* fix the error of tests/quantization/fbgemm_fp8/test_fbgemm_fp8.py::Fb… (#43547) by @sywangyi\r\n* fix fbgemm fp8 multi-device load failure.
