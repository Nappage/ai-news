      "content": "Hi! This app helps you get a clear view of how you are using Claude Code. It shows stats like message counts, token usage, sessions, projects, and even estimates your API costs. One of its best features is the ability to sync your usage across devices, giving you a complete picture over different time periods. It respects your privacy by only collecting aggregated usage data. No conversation or code details are ever touched.<p>There has been some controversy around tracking usage and whether it might lead to price hikes or limits, but honestly, Anthropic probably already knows this data. The app is more about helping you optimise your workflow, not exposing anything sensitive. It also includes a ranking system so you can get a sense of how others are using Claude Code and maybe learn from their patterns.<p>I built it with a solid backend architecture to be scalable and responsive, running on a small Kubernetes cluster. The goal is to help people like us understand and improve how we work with Claude Code, all wrapped up in a simple web and CLI interface.",

It was mostly an experiment to learn about CTFs, MCP servers, Kali Linux, Claude Code, and really just how far LLMs can go in a given domain.<p>It&#x27;s basically just an MCP server (for integrating with the CTF server APIs, providing notes, and a few other niceties) paired with a Kali Linux-based Docker image that has Claude Code installed, plus a custom slash command [1] to tie it all together.<p>It performed admirably during the CTF I tried it on, it was able to zero-shot solve maybe 10 or so of the simpler challenges, and provided substantial assistance on another 5 or 6 before getting stuck. It didn&#x27;t stand a chance against the hardest challenges.<p>This was the first CTF I&#x27;ve participated in, and it was an absolute blast. I can imagine some people feeling that LLMs take the fun out of CTFs, but I think the &quot;centaur&quot; [2] aspect of human-LLM interactions is both powerful and effective, given the right infrastructure and UX.<p>Happy to answer any questions people have about the project!<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.anthropic.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;docs&#x2F;claude-code&#x2F;slash-commands#custom-slash-commands\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.anthropic.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;docs&#x2F;claude-code&#x2F;slash-command...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Advanced_chess\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Advanced_chess</a>",

      "content": "Hi HN,<p>Happy to share the project I&#x27;ve been vibe-coding on for past few months.\nThe Problem: Like many people, I often found myself staring at a fridge full of random ingredients (some about to expire) with no idea what to cook. I was tired of food waste and the repetitive cycle of making the same few meals. I wanted a way to creatively use what I already had.<p>The Solution: So, I decided to build Chefiniti. It&#x27;s an iOS app that acts as a personal AI chef. The core idea is to turn your available food into delicious, custom recipes. I know there are already tons of apps like it but this one is mine :)<p>Here&#x27;s what it can do:\n* Scan Ingredients: Take photos of your fridge or pantry, and the app&#x27;s vision model identifies the ingredients.\n* &quot;Recipefy&quot; a Dish: See a meal you like online or in a restaurant? Snap a photo, and the app generates a recipe to help you recreate it.\n* Generate from Prompt: Just describe what you&#x27;re in the mood for (e.g., &quot;a spicy, gluten-free pasta dish&quot;), and it will create a recipe from scratch.\n* Import from URL: Paste a link from a recipe website to import it into your cookbook.<p>You can also save all these recipes, create shopping lists, and set detailed preferences for diet, allergies, cuisine, and even the cookware you own.\nApp is in a freemium model, within limits you can really test out core features without any payment or even account creation.<p>The Tech Stack: For those interested, the app is built with:\n* Frontend: React Native (with Expo)\n* Backend: Firebase Functions for the API layer.\n* Database &amp; Storage: Firestore and Firebase Cloud Storage.\n* AI: Google&#x27;s Gemini API for recipe generation and analysis.\n* Image Generation: DeepInfra API (for Stable Diffusion).\n* Subscriptions: RevenueCat.<p>I&#x27;ve just launched on the App Store and would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, thoughts, or questions you might have.<p>You can check it out here: \n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chefiniti.app\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chefiniti.app</a>\nOr download directly\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;chefiniti-smart-recipe-creator&#x2F;id6745801080\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;chefiniti-smart-recipe-creator...</a>\nThanks for taking a look!",

      "content": "I read about ingesting PDFs in Google Gemini here on HN last week [1]. This and some other thoughts that I had on AI [2] made me want to create a summarize PDF command line utility. Just point the utility to a PDF and get a summary back. However, I personally prefer to write CLI tools in Rust since those binaries are fast, small, and easy to distribute via `cargo install` (or `cargo binstall`). So that was a problem. I wanted to use a cloud provider since my system doesn&#x27;t have enough RAM for most state-of-the-art models, but at the same time, I didn&#x27;t want to require users of the tool to use the same API provider as me.<p>That&#x27;s why I created the `transformrs` Rust library [3]. The name is from &quot;transform&quot;, which is essentially what AI models do, and &quot;Rust&quot;. It is also a nod to the transformers algorithm.<p>To allow for proper testing in CI, I considered to make a mock endpoint that I could run my tests against. However, AI APIs are so cheap nowadays that I figured I could just as well run the tests against the actual endpoints. So that is what currently happens. Locally and in CI I have set up 5 different API keys and I run multiple tests against all of these endpoints, so that&#x27;s about 30 requests each time (tests run in 10 seconds). I change a file or each push to CI. It&#x27;s incredible how stable these endpoints have become. 18 tests check whether the prompt &quot;This is a test. Please respond with &#x27;hello world&#x27;&quot; actually responds with &quot;hello world&quot; and so far &gt;99% of the times it does. CI is way less flaky than I would have expected.<p>In any case, I hope people will find the library useful. I&#x27;m curious for feedback and suggestions.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=42952605\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=42952605</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huijzer.xyz&#x2F;posts&#x2F;ai-learning-rate&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huijzer.xyz&#x2F;posts&#x2F;ai-learning-rate&#x2F;</a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;transformrs&#x2F;transformrs\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;transformrs&#x2F;transformrs</a>",
