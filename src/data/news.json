This is the first major release in five years, and the release is significant: 800 commits have been pushed to `main` since the latest minor release. This release removes a lot of long-due deprecations, introduces several refactors that significantly simplify our APIs and internals, and comes with a large number of bug fixes.\r\n\r\nWe give an overview of our focus for this release in the [following blogpost](https://huggingface.co/blog/transformers-v5). In these release notes, we'll focus directly on the refactors and new APIs coming with v5.\r\n\r\nThis release is a release candidate (RC). It is not the final v5 release, and we will push on pypi as a pre-release. This means that the current release is purely opt-in, as installing `transformers` without specifying this exact release will install the latest version instead (v4.57.3 as of writing).\r\n\r\nIn order to install this release, please do so with the following:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\npip install transformers --pre\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor us to deliver the best package possible, it is imperative that we have feedback on how the toolkit is currently working for you. Please try it out, and [open an issue](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/) in case you're facing something inconsistent/a bug.\r\n\r\nTransformers version 5 is a community endeavor, and this is the last mile. Let's ship this together!\r\n\r\n## Significant API changes\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> 👀 Nothing is final and things are still actively in movement. We have a section dedicated to what is planned for future release candidates, yet is known not to work in the RC0. Look for \"Disclaimers for the RC0\".\r\n> \r\n> We'll be eagerly awaiting your feedback in our GitHub issues!\r\n\r\n### Dynamic weight loading\r\n\r\nWe introduce a new weight loading API in `transformers`, which significantly improves on the previous API. This\r\nweight loading API is designed to apply operations to the checkpoints loaded by transformers.\r\n\r\nInstead of loading the checkpoint exactly as it is serialized within the model, these operations can reshape, merge,\r\nand split the layers according to how they're defined in this new API. These operations are often a necessity when\r\nworking with quantization or parallelism algorithms.\r\n\r\nThis new API is centered around the new `WeightConverter` class:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass WeightConverter(WeightTransform):\r\n    operations: list[ConversionOps]\r\n    source_keys: Union[str, list[str]]\r\n    target_keys: Union[str, list[str]]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe weight converter is designed to apply a list of operations on the source keys, resulting in target keys. A common\r\noperation done on the attention layers is to fuse the query, key, values layers. Doing so with this API would amount\r\nto defining the following conversion:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nconversion = WeightConverter(\r\n    [\"self_attn.q_proj\", \"self_attn.k_proj\", \"self_attn.v_proj\"],  # The input layers\r\n    \"self_attn.qkv_proj\",  # The single layer as output\r\n    operations=[Concatenate(dim=0)],\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this situation, we apply the `Concatenate` operation, which accepts a list of layers as input and returns a single \r\nlayer. \r\n\r\nThis allows us to define a mapping from architecture to a list of weight conversions. Applying those weight conversions\r\ncan apply arbitrary transformations to the layers themselves. This significantly simplified the `from_pretrained` method\r\nand helped us remove a lot of technical debt that we accumulated over the past few years.\r\n\r\nThis results in several improvements:\r\n- Much cleaner definition of transformations applied to the checkpoint\r\n- Reversible transformations, so loading and saving a checkpoint should result in the same checkpoint\r\n- Faster model loading thanks to scheduling of tensor materialization\r\n- Enables complex mix of transformations that wouldn't otherwise be possible (such as quantization + MoEs, or TP + MoEs)\r\n\r\nWhile this is being implemented, expect varying levels of support across different release candidates.\r\n\r\nLinked PR: https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/41580\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tokenization\r\n\r\nJust as we moved towards a single backend library for model definition, we want our tokenizers, and the `Tokenizer` object to be a lot more intuitive. With v5, tokenizer definition is much simpler; one can now initialize an empty `LlamaTokenizer` and train it directly on your corpus.\r\n\r\nDefining a new tokenizer object should be as simple as this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom transformers import TokenizersBackend, generate_merges\r\nfrom tokenizers import pre_tokenizers, Tokenizer\r\nfrom tokenizers.model import BPE\r\n\r\nclass Llama5Tokenizer(TokenizersBackend):\r\n    def __init__(self, unk_token=\"<unk>\",bos_token=\"<s>\", eos_token=\"</s>\", vocab=None, merges=None ):\r\n        if vocab is None:\r\n            self._vocab = {\r\n                str(unk_token): 0,\r\n                str(bos_token): 1,\r\n                str(eos_token): 2,\r\n            }\r\n\r\n        else:\r\n            self._vocab = vocab\r\n\r\n        if merges is not None:\r\n            self._merges = merges\r\n        else:\r\n            self._merges = generate_merges(filtered_vocab)\r\n\r\n        self._tokenizer = Tokenizer(\r\n            BPE(vocab=self._vocab, merges=self._merges, fuse_unk=True)\r\n        )\r\n        self._tokenizer.pre_tokenizer = pre_tokenizers.Metaspace(\r\n            replacement=\"▁\", prepend_scheme=_get_prepend_scheme(self.add_prefix_space, self), split=False\r\n        )\r\n        super().__init__(\r\n            tokenizer_object=self._tokenizer,\r\n            unk_token=unk_token,\r\n            bos_token=bos_token,\r\n            eos_token=eos_token,\r\n        )\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce the tokenizer is defined as above, you can load it with the following: `Llama5Tokenizer()`. Doing this returns you an empty, trainable tokenizer that follows the definition of the authors of `Llama5` (it does not exist yet :wink:).\r\n\r\nThe above is the main motivation towards refactoring tokenization: we want tokenizers to behave similarly to models: trained or empty, and with exactly what is defined in their class definition.\r\n\r\n### Backend Architecture Changes: moving away from the slow/fast tokenizer separation\r\n\r\nUp to now, transformers maintained two parallel implementations for many tokenizers:\r\n- \"Slow\" tokenizers (`tokenization_<model>.py`) - Python-based implementations, often using [SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece) as the backend.\r\n- \"Fast\" tokenizers (`tokenization_<model>_fast.py`) - Rust-based implementations using the 🤗 [tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers) library.\r\n\r\nIn v5, we consolidate to a single tokenizer file per model: `tokenization_<model>.py`. This file will use the most appropriate backend available:\r\n\r\n1. **TokenizersBackend** (preferred): Rust-based tokenizers from the 🤗 [tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers) library. In general it provides optimal performance, but it also offers a lot more features that are commonly adopted across the ecosystem:\r\n  - handling additional tokens\r\n  - a full python API for setting and updating \r\n  - automatic parallelization,\r\n  - automatic offsets\r\n  - customization\r\n  - training\r\n2. **SentencePieceBackend**: for tokenizers requiring the `sentencepiece` library. It inherits from `PythonBackend`. \r\n3. **PythonBackend**: a Python implementations of the features provided by `tokenizers`. Basically allows adding tokens.\r\n4. **MistralCommonBackend**: relies on `MistralCommon`'s tokenization library. (Previously known as the `MistralCommonTokenizer`)\r\n\r\nThe `AutoTokenizer` automatically selects the appropriate backend based on available files and dependencies. This is transparent, you continue to use `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained()` as before. This allows transformers to be future-proof and modular to easily support future backends.\r\n\r\n### Defining a tokenizers outside of the existing backends\r\n\r\nWe enable users and tokenizer builders to define their own tokenizers from top to bottom. Tokenizers are usually defined using a backend such as `tokenizers`, `sentencepiece` or `mistral-common`, but we offer the possibility to design the tokenizer at a higher-level, without relying on those backends.\r\n\r\nTo do so, you can import the `PythonBackend` (which was previously known as `PreTrainedTokenizer`). This class encapsulates all the logic related to added tokens, encoding, and decoding.\r\n\r\nIf you want something even higher up the stack, then `PreTrainedTokenizerBase` is what `PythonBackend` inherits from. It contains the very basic tokenizer API features: \r\n- `encode`\r\n- `decode`\r\n- `vocab_size`\r\n- `get_vocab`\r\n- `convert_tokens_to_ids`\r\n- `convert_ids_to_tokens`\r\n- `from_pretrained`\r\n- `save_pretrained`\r\n- among a few others\r\n\r\n### API Changes\r\n\r\n#### 1. Direct tokenizer initialization with vocab and merges\r\n\r\nStarting with v5, we now enable initializing blank, untrained `tokenizers`-backed tokenizers:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom transformers import LlamaTokenizer\r\n\r\ntokenizer = LlamaTokenizer()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis tokenizer will therefore follow the definition of the `LlamaTokenizer` as defined in its class definition. It can then be trained on a corpus as can be seen in [the `tokenizers` documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/tokenizers/training_from_memory).\r\n\r\nThese tokenizers can also be initialized from vocab and merges (if necessary), like the previous \"slow\" tokenizers:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom transformers import LlamaTokenizer\r\n\r\nvocab = {\"<unk>\": 0, \"<s>\": 1, \"</s>\": 2, \"hello\": 3, \"world\": 4}\r\nmerges = [(\"h\", \"e\"), (\"l\", \"l\"), (\"o\", \" \")]\r\n\r\ntokenizer = LlamaTokenizer(vocab=vocab, merges=merges)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis tokenizer will behave as a Llama-like tokenizer, with an updated vocabulary. This allows comparing different tokenizer classes with the same vocab; therefore enabling the comparison of different pre-tokenizers, normalizers, etc.\r\n\r\n⚠️ The `vocab_file` (as in, a path towards a file containing the vocabulary) cannot be used to initialize the `LlamaTokenizer` as loading from files is reserved to the `from_pretrained` method.\r\n\r\n#### 2. Simplified decoding API\r\n\r\nThe `batch_decode` and `decode` methods have been unified to reflect behavior of the `encode` method. Both single and batch decoding now use the same `decode` method. See an example of the new behavior below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer\r\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"t5-small\") \r\ninputs = [\"hey how are you?\", \"fine\"]\r\ntokenizer.decode(tokenizer.encode(inputs))\r\n```\r\n\r\nGives:\r\n```diff\r\n- 'hey how are you?</s> fine</s>'\r\n+ ['hey how are you?</s>', 'fine</s>']\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe expect `encode` and `decode` to behave, as two sides of the same coin: `encode`, `process`, `decode`,  should work. \r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> A common use-case would be: `encode`, `model.generate`, `decode`.  However, using `generate` would return `list[list[int]]`, which would then be incompatible with `decode`.\r\n\r\n#### 3. Unified encoding API\r\n\r\nThe `encode_plus` method is deprecated in favor of the single `__call__` method.\r\n\r\n#### 4. `apply_chat_template` returns `BatchEncoding`\r\n\r\nPreviously, `apply_chat_template` returned `input_ids` for backward compatibility. Starting with v5, it now consistently returns a `BatchEncoding` dict like other tokenizer methods.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# v5\r\nmessages = [\r\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello!\"},\r\n    {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Hi there!\"}\r\n]\r\n\r\n# Now returns BatchEncoding with input_ids, attention_mask, etc.\r\noutputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, return_tensors=\"pt\")\r\nprint(outputs.keys())  # dict_keys(['input_ids', 'attention_mask'])\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 5. Removed legacy configuration file saving:\r\n\r\nWe simplify the serialization of tokenization attributes:\r\n\r\n- `special_tokens_map.json` - special tokens are now stored in `tokenizer_config.json`.\r\n- `added_tokens.json` - added tokens are now stored in `tokenizer.json`.\r\n- `added_tokens_decoder` is only stored when there is no `tokenizer.json`.\r\n\r\nWhen loading older tokenizers, these files are still read for backward compatibility, but new saves use the consolidated format. We're gradually moving towards consolidating attributes to fewer files so that other libraries and implementations may depend on them more reliably.\r\n\r\n#### 6. Model-Specific Changes\r\n\r\nSeveral models that had identical tokenizers now import from their base implementation:\r\n\r\n- **LayoutLM** → uses BertTokenizer\r\n- **LED** → uses BartTokenizer  \r\n- **Longformer** → uses RobertaTokenizer\r\n- **LXMert** → uses BertTokenizer\r\n- **MT5** → uses T5Tokenizer\r\n- **MVP** → uses BartTokenizer\r\n\r\nThese modules will eventually be removed altogether.\r\n\r\n**Removed T5-specific workarounds**\r\n\r\nThe internal `_eventually_correct_t5_max_length` method has been removed. T5 tokenizers now handle max length consistently with other models.\r\n\r\n### Testing Changes\r\n\r\nA few testing changes specific to tokenizers have been applied:\r\n- Model-specific tokenization test files now focus on integration tests.\r\n- Common tokenization API tests (e.g., `add_tokens`, `encode`, `decode`) are now centralized and automatically applied across all tokenizers. This reduces test duplication and ensures consistent behavior\r\n\r\nFor legacy implementations, the original BERT Python tokenizer code (including `WhitespaceTokenizer`, `BasicTokenizer`, etc.) is preserved in `bert_legacy.py` for reference purposes.\r\n\r\n#### 7. Deprecated / Modified Features\r\n\r\n**Special Tokens Structure:**\r\n- `SpecialTokensMixin`: Merged into `PreTrainedTokenizerBase` to simplify the tokenizer architecture.\r\n- `special_tokens_map`: Now only stores named special token attributes (e.g., `bos_token`, `eos_token`). Use `extra_special_tokens` for additional special tokens (formerly `additional_special_tokens`). `all_special_tokens` includes both named and extra tokens.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# v4\r\ntokenizer.special_tokens_map  # Included 'additional_special_tokens'\r\n\r\n# v5\r\ntokenizer.special_tokens_map  # Only named tokens\r\ntokenizer.extra_special_tokens  # Additional tokens\r\n```\r\n\r\n- `special_tokens_map_extended` and `all_special_tokens_extended`: Removed. Access `AddedToken` objects directly from `_special_tokens_map` or `_extra_special_tokens` if needed.\r\n- `additional_special_tokens`: Still accepted for backward compatibility but is automatically converted to `extra_special_tokens`.\r\n\r\n**Deprecated Methods:**\r\n- `sanitize_special_tokens()`: Already deprecated in v4, removed in v5.\r\n- `prepare_seq2seq_batch()`: Deprecated; use `__call__()` with `text_target` parameter instead.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# v4\r\nmodel_inputs = tokenizer.prepare_seq2seq_batch(src_texts, tgt_texts, max_length=128)\r\n\r\n# v5\r\nmodel_inputs = tokenizer(src_texts, text_target=tgt_texts, max_length=128, return_tensors=\"pt\")\r\nmodel_inputs[\"labels\"] = model_inputs.pop(\"input_ids_target\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n- `BatchEncoding.words()`: Deprecated; use `word_ids()` instead.\r\n\r\n**Removed Methods:**\r\n- `create_token_type_ids_from_sequences()`: Removed from base class. Subclasses that need custom token type ID creation should implement this method directly.\r\n- `clean_up_tokenization()`: Removed from base class. Now defined at model class level for models that need it (e.g., PLBart, CLVP, Wav2Vec2).\r\n- `prepare_for_model()`, `build_inputs_with_special_tokens()`, `truncate_sequences()`: Moved from `tokenization_utils_base.py` to `tokenization_python.py` for `PythonBackend` tokenizers. `TokenizersBackend` provides model-ready input via `tokenize()` and `encode()`, so these methods are no longer needed in the base class.\r\n- `_switch_to_input_mode()`, `_switch_to_target_mode()`, `as_target_tokenizer()`: Removed from base class. Use `__call__()` with `text_target` parameter instead.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# v4\r\nwith tokenizer.as_target_tokenizer():\r\n    labels = tokenizer(tgt_texts, ...)\r\n\r\n# v5\r\nlabels = tokenizer(text_target=tgt_texts, ...)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- `parse_response()`: Removed from base class.\r\n\r\n## Disclaimers for the RC0\r\n\r\n### PEFT + MoE:\r\n\r\nBecause we are switching from the naive MOE (`nn.ModuleList` for experts) we currently have an issue with MoEs that have adapters. For more details see https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/42491#issuecomment-3591485649. \r\n\r\n_We aim for this to be fixed and released in a following release candidate in the week that follows RC0._\r\n\r\n### Tensor parallel and Expert parallel + MoE\r\n\r\nWe are streamlining the MoE support with vLLM; while this is being implemented, tensor parallelism and expert parallelism aren't working as expected.\r\nThis is known and actively being worked on.\r\n\r\n_We aim for this to be fixed and released in a following release candidate in the week that follows RC0._\r\n\r\n### Custom pretrained models:\r\nFor anyone inheriting from a `transformers` `PreTrainedModel`, the weights are automatically initialized with the common scheme: \r\n```python\r\n\r\n    @torch.no_grad()\r\n    def _init_weights(self, module):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Initialize the weights. This is quite general on purpose, in the spirit of what we usually do. For more complex\r\n        initialization scheme, it should be overridden by the derived `PreTrainedModel` class. In case a model adds an explicit\r\n        `nn.Parameter`, this method should also be overridden in order to initialize it correctly.\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        if hasattr(self.config, \"initializer_range\"):\r\n            std = self.config.initializer_range or 0.02\r\n        elif hasattr(self.config, \"init_std\"):\r\n            std = self.config.init_std\r\n        elif hasattr(self.config, \"initializer_factor\"):\r\n            std = self.config.initializer_factor\r\n        else:\r\n            # 0.02 is the standard default value across the library\r\n            std = getattr(self.config.get_text_config(), \"initializer_range\", 0.02)\r\n\r\n        if isinstance(module, (nn.Linear, nn.Conv1d, nn.Conv2d, nn.Conv3d, nn.ConvTranspose1d, nn.ConvTranspose2d)):\r\n            if getattr(module, \"weight\", None) is not None:\r\n                init.normal_(module.weight, mean=0.0, std=std)\r\n            if getattr(module, \"bias\", None) is not None:\r\n                init.zeros_(module.bias)\r\n        elif isinstance(module, nn.Embedding):\r\n            if getattr(module, \"weight\", None) is not None:\r\n                init.normal_(module.weight, mean=0.0, std=std)\r\n                # Here we need the check explicitly, as we slice the weight in the `zeros_` call, so it looses the flag\r\n                if module.padding_idx is not None and not getattr(module.weight, \"_is_hf_initialized\", False):\r\n                    init.zeros_(module.weight[module.padding_idx])\r\n        elif isinstance(module, nn.MultiheadAttention):\r\n            # This uses torch's original init\r\n            module._reset_parameters()\r\n        # We cannot use `isinstance` on the RMSNorms or LayerNorms, as they usually are custom modules which change names\r\n        # between modelings (because they are prefixed with the model name)\r\n        elif (\r\n            isinstance(module, (nn.GroupNorm, nn.BatchNorm1d, nn.BatchNorm2d, nn.BatchNorm3d))\r\n            or \"LayerNorm\" in module.__class__.__name__\r\n            or \"RMSNorm\" in module.__class__.__name__\r\n        ):\r\n            # Norms can exist without weights (in which case they are None from torch primitives)\r\n            if hasattr(module, \"weight\") and module.weight is not None:\r\n                init.ones_(module.weight)\r\n            if hasattr(module, \"bias\") and module.bias is not None:\r\n                init.zeros_(module.bias)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to avoid that, for now you should just do:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass CustomModel(Qwen3VLForConditionalGeneration):\r\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\r\n        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\r\n        self.action_head = nn.Linear(1024, 7)\r\n        self.positional_embedding = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(16, 1152))\r\n        self.post_init()\r\n    \r\n    def _init_weights(self, module):\r\n        pass \r\n\r\n```\r\nThere is a tracker for that here: https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/42418.\r\n\r\n## Library-wide changes with lesser impact\r\n\r\n### `use_auth_token`\r\n\r\nThe `use_auth_token` argument/parameter is deprecated in favor of `token` everywhere.\r\nYou should be able to search and replace `use_auth_token` with `token` and get the same logic.\r\n\r\nLinked PR: https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/41666\r\n\r\n### Attention-related features\r\n\r\nWe decided to remove some features for the upcoming v5 as they are currently only supported in a few old models and no longer integrated in current model additions. It's recommended to stick to v4.x in case you need them. Following features are affected:\r\n- No more head masking, see [#41076](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/41076). This feature allowed to turn off certain heads during the attention calculation and only worked for eager.\r\n- No more relative positional biases in Bert-like models, see [#41170](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/41170). This feature was introduced to allow relative position scores within attention calculations (similar to T5). However, this feature is barely used in official models and a lot of complexity instead. It also only worked with eager.\r\n- No more head pruning, see [#41417](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/41417) by @gante. As the name suggests, it allowed to prune heads within your attention layers.\r\n\r\n### Updates to supported torch APIs\r\n\r\nWe dropped support for two torch APIs:\r\n- `torchscript` in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/41688\r\n- `torch.fx` in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/41683\r\n\r\nThose APIs were deprecated by the PyTorch team, and we're instead focusing on the supported APIs `dynamo` and `export`.\r\n\r\n## Quantization changes\r\n\r\nWe clean up the quantization API in transformers, and significantly refactor the weight loading as highlighted\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nWe drop support for two quantization arguments that have been deprecated for some time:\r\n- `load_in_4bit`\r\n- `load_in_8bit`\r\n\r\nWe remove them in favor of the `quantization_config` argument which is much more complete. As an example, here is how\r\nyou would load a 4-bit bitsandbytes model using this argument:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, BitsAndBytesConfig\r\n\r\nquantization_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(load_in_4bit=True)\r\n\r\nmodel_4bit = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\r\n    \"meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B\",\r\n    device_map=\"auto\",\r\n    quantization_config=quantization_config\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\n- Methods to init a nested config such as `from_xxx_config` are deleted. Configs can be init from the `__init__` method in the same way. See [#41314](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/41314).\r\n- It is no longer possible to load a config class from a URL file. Configs must be loaded from either a local path or a repo on the Hub. See [#42383](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/42383).\r\n- All parameters for configuring model's rotary embedding are now stored under `mode.rope_parameters`, including the `rope_theta` and `rope_type`. Model's `config.rope_parameters` is a simple dictionaty in most cases, and can also be a nested dict in special cases (i.e. Gemma3 and ModernBert) with different rope parameterization for each layer type. Trying to get `config.rope_theta` will throw an attribute error from now on. See [#39847](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/39847) and [#42255](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/42255)\r\n- Qwen-VL family configuration is in a nested format and trying to access keys directly will throw an error (e.g. `config.vocab_size`). Users are expected to access keys from their respective sub-configs (`config.text_config.vocab_size`).\r\n- Configurations of non-generative models (any model that doesn't call `model.generate()`) will no longer have a `generation_config` and `model.config.generation_config` will throw an attribute error.\r\n\r\n## Processing\r\n\r\n### Tokenization\r\n\r\n- Slow tokenizer files (aka: `tokenization_<model>.py` ) will be removed in favor of using fast tokenizer files `tokenization_<model>_fast.py` --> will be renamed to `tokenization_<model>.py`.  As fast tokenizers are :hugs:`tokenizers` - backend, they include a wider range of features that are maintainable and reliable. \r\n- Other backends (sentence piece, tokenizers, etc.) will be supported with a light layer if loading a fast tokenizer fails\r\n- Remove legacy files like special_tokens_map.json and added_tokens.json\r\n- Remove _eventually_correct_t5_max_length \r\n- `encode_plus` --> `__call__`\r\n- `batch_decode` --> `decode`\r\n\r\n`apply_chat_template` by default returns naked `input_ids` rather than a `BatchEncoding` dict. \r\nThis was inconvenient - it should return a `BatchEncoding` dict like `tokenizer.__call__()`, but we were stuck with \r\nit for backward compatibility. The method now returns a `BatchEncoding`.\r\n\r\nLinked PRs: \r\n- https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/40938\r\n- https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/40936\r\n- https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/41626\r\n\r\n### Processing classes\r\n\r\n- In processing classes each attribute will be serialized under `processor_config.json` as a nested dict, instead of serializing attributes in their own config files. Loading will be supported for all old format processors (https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/41474)\r\n- `XXXFeatureExtractors` classes are completely removed in favor of `XXXImageProcessor` class for all vision models (https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/41174)\r\n- Minor change: `XXXFastImageProcessorKwargs` is removed in favor of `XXXImageProcessorKwargs` which will be shared between fast and slow processors (https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/40931)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Modeling\r\n\r\n- Some `RotaryEmbeddings` layers will start returning a dict of tuples, in case the model uses several RoPE configurations (Gemma2, ModernBert). Each value will be a tuple of \"cos, sin\" per RoPE type.\r\n- Config attribute for `RotaryEmbeddings` layer will be unified and accessed via `config.rope_parameters`. Config attr for `rope_theta` might not be accessible anymore for some models, and instead will be in `config.rope_parameters['rope_theta']`. BC will be supported for a while as much as possible, and in the near future we'll gradually move to the new RoPE format  (https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/39847)\r\n- Vision Language models will not have a shortcut access to its language and vision component from the generative model via `model.language_model`. It is recommended to either access the module with `model.model.language_model` or `model.get_decoder()`. See [#42156](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/42156/)\r\n\r\n### Generate\r\n\r\n- Old, deprecated output type aliases were removed (e.g. `GreedySearchEncoderDecoderOutput`). We now only have 4 output classes built from the following matrix: decoder-only vs encoder-decoder, uses beams vs doesn't use beams (https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/40998)\r\n- Removed deprecated classes regarding decoding methods that were moved to the Hub due to low usage (constraints and beam scores) (https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/41223)\r\n- If `generate` doesn't receive any KV Cache argument, the default cache class used is now defined by the model (as opposed to always being `DynamicCache`) (https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/41505)\r\n- Generation parameters are no longer accessible via model's config. If generation paramaters are serialized in `config.json` for any old model, it will be loaded back into model's generation config. Users are expected to access or modify generation parameters only with `model.generation_config.do_sample = True`. \r\n\r\n## Trainer\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n\r\n* **ALST/Ulysses Sequence Parallelism Integration**\r\n  - Added sequence parallelism support via HF Accelerate for training with longer sequences. Enables splitting sequences across devices using ALST (All-to-All Long Sequence Training) and Ulysses algorithms with DeepSpeed.\r\n* **Improved `compute_loss_func` Handling**\r\n  - `compute_loss_func` now always takes priority over the model's built-in loss computation, giving users consistent control over custom loss functions.\r\n* **`num_items_in_batch` in Prediction Step**\r\n  - The `num_items_in_batch` argument is now passed to `compute_loss` during `prediction_step`, enabling proper loss scaling during evaluation.\r\n\r\n### Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n* **`report_to` now defaults to `\"none\"`**\r\n  - Logging integrations are no longer auto-detected by default; users must explicitly specify which reporting backends to use.\r\n\r\n### Removing arguments without deprecation cycle in `TrainingArguments` due to low usage\r\n\r\n- `mp_parameters` -> legacy param that was later on added to the Sagemaker trainer\r\n- `_n_gpu` -> not intended for users to set, we will initialize it correctly instead of putting it in the `TrainingArguments`\r\n- `overwrite_output_dir` - > replaced by `resume_from_checkpoint`, and it was only used in the examples script, no impact on Trainer. \r\n- `logging_dir` -> only used for tensorboard, set `TENSORBOARD_LOGGING_DIR` env var instead\r\n- `jit_mode_eval` -> use `use_torch_compile` instead, as torchscript is not recommended anymore\r\n- `tpu_num_cores`-> It is actually better to remove it, as it is not recommended to set the number of cores. By default, all TPU cores are used . Set `TPU_NUM_CORES` env var instead\r\n- `past_index` -> it was only used for a very small number of models that have special architecture like transformersxl + it was not documented at all how to train those models\r\n- `ray_scope` -> only for a minor arg for ray integration. Set `RAY_SCOPE` var env instead \r\n- `warmup_ratio` -> use `warmup_step` instead. We combined both args together by allowing passing float values in `warmup_step`. \r\n\r\n### Removing deprecated arguments in `TrainingArguments`\r\n\r\n- `fsdp_min_num_params` and `fsdp_transformer_layer_cls_to_wrap` -> use `fsdp_config`\r\n- `tpu_metrics_debug` -> `debug` \r\n- `push_to_hub_token` -> `hub_token`\r\n- `push_to_hub_model_id` and `push_to_hub_organization` -> `hub_model_id`\r\n- `include_inputs_for_metrics` -> `include_for_metrics`\r\n- `per_gpu_train_batch_size` -> `per_device_train_batch_size`\r\n- `per_gpu_eval_batch_size` -> `per_device_eval_batch_size`\r\n- `use_mps_device` -> mps will be used by default if detected\r\n- `fp16_backend` and `half_precision_backend` -> we will only rely on `torch.amp` as everything has been upstreamed to torch\r\n- `no_cuda` -> `use_cpu`\r\n- ` include_tokens_per_second` -> `include_num_input_tokens_seen`\r\n- `use_legacy_prediction_loop` -> we only use `evaluation_loop` function from now on\r\n\r\n### Removing deprecated arguments in `Trainer`\r\n\r\n- `tokenizer` in initialization -> `processing_class`\r\n- `model_path` in train() -> `resume_from_checkpoint`\r\n\r\n### Removed features for `Trainer`\r\n\r\n- sigpot integration for hp search was removed as the library was archived + the api stopped working\r\n- drop support for sagemaker API <1.10\r\n- bump accelerate minimum version to 1.1.0 \r\n- bump peft minimum version to 0.18.0\r\n- bump bitsandbytes minimum version to 0.46.1\r\n\r\n###  New defaults for `Trainer`\r\n\r\n- `use_cache` in the model config will be set to `False`. You can still change the cache value through `TrainingArguments` `usel_cache` argument if needed. \r\n\r\n## Pipeline\r\n\r\n- Image text to text pipelines will no longer accept images as a separate argument along with conversation chats. Image data has to be embedded in the chat's \"content\" field. See [#42359](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/42359)\r\n\r\n## PushToHubMixin\r\n\r\n- removed deprecated `organization` and `repo_url` from `PushToHubMixin`. You must pass a `repo_id` instead.\r\n- removed `ignore_metadata_errors` from `PushToMixin`. In practice if we ignore errors while loading the model card, we won't be able to push the card back to the Hub so it's better to fail early and not provide the option to fail later.\r\n- `push_to_hub` do not accept `**kwargs` anymore. All accepted parameters are explicitly documented.\r\n- arguments of `push_to_hub` are now keyword-only to avoid confusion. Only `repo_id` can be positional since it's the main arg.\r\n- removed `use_temp_dir` argument from `push_to_hub`. We now use a tmp dir in all cases.\r\n\r\nLinked PR: https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/42391.\r\n\r\n## CLI\r\n\r\nThe deprecated `transformers-cli ...` command was deprecated, `transformers ...` is now the only CLI entry point.\r\n\r\n`transformers` CLI has been migrated to `Typer`, making it easier to maintain + adding some nice features out of \r\nthe box (improved `--help` section, autocompletion).\r\n\r\nBiggest breaking change is in `transformers chat`. This command starts a terminal UI to interact with a chat model. \r\nIt used to also be able to start a Chat Completion server powered by `transformers` and chat with it. In this revamped \r\nversion, this feature has been removed in favor of `transformers serve`. The goal of splitting `transformers chat` \r\nand `transformers serve` is to define clear boundaries between client and server code. It helps with maintenance \r\nbut also makes the commands less bloated. The new signature of `transformers chat` is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUsage: transformers chat [OPTIONS] BASE_URL MODEL_ID [GENERATE_FLAGS]...\r\n\r\nChat with a model from the command line.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt works hand in hand with `transformers serve`, which means that if `transformers serve` is running on its default endpoint, `transformers chat` can be launched as follows:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ntransformers chat HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM3-3B\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt can however use any OpenAI API compatible HTTP endpoint:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ntransformers chat HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM3-3B https://router.huggingface.co/v1\r\n```\r\n\r\nLinked PRs: \r\n- https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/40997\r\n- https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/41487\r\n\r\n### Removal of the `run` method\r\n\r\nThe `transformers run` (previously `transformers-cli run`) is an artefact of the past, was not documented nor tested,\r\nand isn't part of any public documentation. We're removing it for now and ask you to please let us know in case\r\nthis is a method you are using; in which case we should bring it back with better support.\r\n\r\nLinked PR: https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/42447\r\n\r\n## Environment variables\r\n\r\n- Legacy environment variables like `TRANSFORMERS_CACHE`, `PYTORCH_TRANSFORMERS_CACHE`, and `PYTORCH_PRETRAINED_BERT_CACHE` have been removed. Please use `HF_HOME` instead.\r\n- Constants `HUGGINGFACE_CO_EXAMPLES_TELEMETRY`, `HUGGINGFACE_CO_EXAMPLES_TELEMETRY`, `HUGGINGFACE_CO_PREFIX`, and `HUGGINGFACE_CO_RESOLVE_ENDPOINT` have been removed. Please use `huggingface_hub.constants.ENDPOINT` instead.\r\n\r\nLinked PR: https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/42391.\r\n\r\n## Requirements update\r\n\r\n`transformers` v5 pins the `huggingface_hub` version to `>=1.0.0`. See this [migration guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/concepts/migration) to learn more about this major release. Here are to main aspects to know about:\r\n- switched the HTTP backend from `requests` to `httpx`. This change was made to improve performance and to support both synchronous and asynchronous requests the same way. If you are currently catching `requests.HTTPError` errors in your codebase, you'll need to switch to `httpx.HTTPError`.\r\n- related to 1., it is not possible to set proxies from your script. To handle proxies, you must set the `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables\r\n- `hf_transfer` and therefore `HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER` have been completed dropped in favor of `hf_xet`. This should be transparent for most users. Please let us know if you notice any downside!\r\n\r\n`typer-slim` has been added as required dependency, used to implement both `hf` and `transformers` CLIs.\r\n\r\n## New model additions in v5\r\n\r\n### CWM\r\n\r\n<img width=\"809\" height=\"471\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58bb9c70-d481-48ed-ab8f-6553be7c240f\" />\r\n\r\nThe Code World Model (CWM) model was proposed in [CWM: An Open-Weights LLM for Research on Code Generation with World Models](https://ai.facebook.com/research/publications/cwm) by Meta FAIR CodeGen Team. CWM is an LLM for code generation and reasoning about code that has, in particular, been trained to better represent and reason about how code and commands affect the state of a program or system. Specifically, we mid-trained CWM on a large number of observation-action trajectories from Python execution traces and agentic interactions in containerized environments. We post-trained with extensive multi-task RL in verifiable coding, math, and multi-turn software engineering environments.\r\n\r\n* Add Code World Model (CWM)  by @jacobkahn in #41199\r\n\r\n### SAM3\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1505\" height=\"915\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eec48633-f02b-464a-ae5c-c65473387e53\" />\r\n\r\nSAM3 (Segment Anything Model 3) was introduced in [SAM 3: Segment Anything with Concepts](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/sam-3-segment-anything-with-concepts/).\r\n\r\nThe SAM3 addition adds four new architectures:\r\n- Sam3\r\n- Sam3Tracker\r\n- Sam3TrackerVideo\r\n- Sam3Video\r\n\r\nSAM3 performs Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS) on images. PCS takes text and/or image exemplars as input (e.g., \"yellow school bus\"), and predicts instance and semantic masks for every single object matching the concept.\r\n\r\nSam3Tracker and Sam3TrackerVideo perform Promptable Visual Segmentation (PVS) on images. PVS takes interactive visual prompts (points, boxes, masks) or text inputs to segment a specific object instance per prompt. This is the task that SAM 1 and SAM 2 focused on, and SAM 3 improves upon it. Sam3Tracker and Sam3TrackerVideo are updated versions of SAM2 Video that maintain the same API while providing improved performance and capabilities.\r\n\r\nSAM3 Video performs Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS) on videos. PCS takes text as input (e.g., \"yellow school bus\"), and predicts instance and semantic masks for every single object matching the concept, while preserving object identities across video frames. The model combines a detection module (SAM3) with a tracking module (SAM2-style tracker) to enable robust object tracking across video frames using text prompts.\r\n\r\n* Add SAM3 to 🤗 Transformers  by @yonigozlan in #42285\r\n\r\n### LFM2 MoE\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1080\" height=\"849\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9fa1b81-114d-4054-9699-5083ac69d830\" />\r\n\r\nLFM2-MoE is a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) variant of [LFM2](https://huggingface.co/collections/LiquidAI/lfm2-686d721927015b2ad73eaa38). The LFM2 family is optimized for on-device inference by combining short‑range, input‑aware gated convolutions with grouped‑query attention (GQA) in a layout tuned to maximize quality under strict speed and memory constraints.\r\n\r\nLFM2‑MoE keeps this fast backbone and introduces sparse MoE feed‑forward networks to add representational capacity without significantly increasing the active compute path. The first LFM2-MoE release is LFM2-8B-A1B, with 8.3B total parameters and 1.5B active parameters. The model excels in quality (comparable to 3-4B dense models) and speed (faster than other 1.5B class models).\r\n\r\n* [Model] Lfm2Moe  by @paulpak58 in #41401\r\n\r\n### VideoLlama 3\r\n\r\n<img width=\"812\" height=\"366\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21c82c6e-cf0a-4d6c-a707-b9e57663ca85\" />\r\n\r\nThe [VideoLLaMA3](https://huggingface.co/papers/2501.13106) model is a major update to [VideoLLaMA2](https://huggingface.co/papers/2406.07476) from Alibaba DAMO Academy.\r\n\r\n* [model] Add VideoLLaMA3 implementation  by @lkhl in #40499\r\n\r\n### AudioFlamingo 3\r\n\r\n<img width=\"621\" height=\"475\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9616758-b3aa-41d0-bd58-695966ba146d\" />\r\n\r\nAudio Flamingo 3 (AF3) is a fully open large audio–language model designed for robust understanding and reasoning over speech, environmental sounds, and music. AF3 pairs a Whisper-style audio encoder with a causal language model and performs replace-in-place audio–text fusion: the processor aligns post-pool audio frames to a dedicated placeholder token and the model replaces those token slots with projected audio embeddings during the forward pass.\r\n\r\nThe model checkpoint is available at: [nvidia/audio-flamingo-3-hf](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/audio-flamingo-3-hf)\r\n\r\nHighlights:\r\n\r\n- Unified audio encoder across speech, sound, and music.\r\n- Long-audio support via windowing and post-pool alignment (up to 10 minutes maximum). The model processes audio in 30-second windows with a hard limit of 20 windows (10 minutes total). Audio longer than 10 minutes will be truncated.\r\n- Deterministic fusion that preserves sequence length by replacing audio placeholder tokens with audio embeddings.\r\n\r\n* [models] Add AudioFlamingo3 integration  by @lashahub in #40290\r\n\r\n### Nanochat\r\n\r\n[NanoChat](https://huggingface.co/karpathy/nanochat-d32) is a compact decoder-only transformer model designed for educational purposes and efficient training. The model features several fundamental architectural innovations which are common in modern transformer models. Therefore, it is a good model to use as a starting point to understand the principles of modern transformer models. NanoChat is a variant of the [Llama](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/llama) architecture, with simplified attention mechanism and normalization layers.\r\n\r\n* [MODEL] Nanochat

File operations prioritized, and shell commands can be disabled.<p>Plugin Architecture - Extend capabilities through drop-in plugins. Add SQL queries, web scraping or block dangerous commands with 100 lines of Python.<p>Modern CLI - Clear interface with task planning and listing, file content previews, diff editing, API usage tracking, code linting, waiting animations and rich tree displays for informed user decisions.<p>Provider Independence - Works with any OpenAI-compatible API, including local models.<p>tl;dr: similar idea to Claude Code (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;claude.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;claude-code\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;claude.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;claude-code</a>) or Aider (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aider.chat&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aider.chat&#x2F;</a>), focusing on providing explicit user consent, granular configuration, drop-in plugins and the ability to integrate any model, backend or API.<p>See the Features for more: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FSilveiraa&#x2F;solveig&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;docs&#x2F;about.md#features-and-principles\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FSilveiraa&#x2F;solveig&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;docs&#x2F;about.m...</a><p>---<p>TYPICAL TASKS<p>- &quot;Find and list all the duplicate files inside ~&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;&quot;\n- &quot;Check my essay Final.docx for spelling, syntax or factual errors while maintaining the tone&quot;\n- &quot;Refactor my test_database.ts suite to be more concise&quot;\n- &quot;Try and find out why my computer is slow&quot;\n- &quot;Create a dockerized BlackSheep webapp with a test suite, then build the image and run it locally&quot;<p>---<p>So it&#x27;s a coding assistant?<p>You can use Solveig for analyzing, editing and testing your code, and all of these scenarios have received significant support through development features like code linting. But I didn&#x27;t build Solveig with a single kind of use case in mind.<p>---<p>So it&#x27;s yet another LLM-in-my-terminal?<p>Sort of. Solveig tries to do a few things that other tools don&#x27;t, and to do the shared features with clearer UX, explicit consent, and deeper configuration. It&#x27;s not an IDE extension, doesn&#x27;t require a GUI, and it&#x27;s not built for a specific user type or scenario.<p>At the same time, Solveig&#x27;s competitors are mature projects with real user testing that you should check out. I&#x27;ve written a detailed comparison (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FSilveiraa&#x2F;solveig&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;docs&#x2F;comparison.md\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FSilveiraa&#x2F;solveig&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;docs&#x2F;compari...</a>) to similar tools in the market in the docs.<p>---<p>UPCOMING<p>I have a Roadmap (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FSilveiraa&#x2F;solveig&#x2F;discussions&#x2F;2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FSilveiraa&#x2F;solveig&#x2F;discussions&#x2F;2</a>) available, and feel free to suggest new features or improvements. I&#x27;ve recently added user-defined system prompt templates, and now I&#x27;m working on adding token counting from API messages instead of relying on encoders.<p>---<p>A cool aspect of this project is that I can use Solveig to analyze and improve its own code itself, which also gives me a lot of exposure to its actual usability.<p>I appreciate any feedback or comment, especially anyone who can try out Solveig using Anthropic or Gemini APIs. Tell me if it helped you do something or what stopped you from using it properly in your specific case. Even if you can&#x27;t see how Solveig could help you let me know, that&#x27;s an issue with me communicating value that I need to fix.<p>Leaving a star on the repository (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FSilveiraa&#x2F;solveig\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FSilveiraa&#x2F;solveig</a>) is also very much appreciated.",
