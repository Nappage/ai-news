Unlike the offline [Voxtral](./voxtral) model which processes complete audio files, VoxtralRealtime is architected for low-latency, incremental transcription by processing audio in chunks as they arrive.\r\n\r\nThe model combines an audio encoder with a Mistral-based language model decoder, using time conditioning embeddings and causal convolutions with padding caches to enable efficient streaming inference.\r\n\r\n* Add Voxtral Realtime (#43769) by @eustlb\r\n\r\n### GLM-5 - GlmMoeDsa\r\n\r\n<img width=\"947\" height=\"638\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c4fff37-7f40-4e86-b4a0-db718f45c93b\" />\r\n\r\nThe zAI team launches GLM-5, and introduces it as such:\r\n\r\n> GLM-5, targeting complex systems engineering and long-horizon agentic tasks. Scaling is still one of the most important ways to improve the intelligence efficiency of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Compared to GLM-4.5, GLM-5 scales from 355B parameters (32B active) to 744B parameters (40B active), and increases pre-training data from 23T to 28.5T tokens. GLM-5 also integrates DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA), largely reducing deployment cost while preserving long-context capacity.\r\n> \r\n> Reinforcement learning aims to bridge the gap between competence and excellence in pre-trained models. However, deploying it at scale for LLMs is a challenge due to the RL training inefficiency. To this end, we developed [slime](https://github.com/THUDM/slime), a novel asynchronous RL infrastructure that substantially improves training throughput and efficiency, enabling more fine-grained post-training iterations. With advances in both pre-training and post-training, GLM-5 delivers significant improvement compared to GLM-4.7 across a wide range of academic benchmarks and achieves best-in-class performance among all open-source models in the world on reasoning, coding, and agentic tasks, closing the gap with frontier models.\r\n\r\n* Add GlmMoeDsa (#43858) by @Cyrilvallez\r\n\r\n### Qwen3.5, Qwen3.5 Moe\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b56dcaca-80e7-4b22-80a5-2f767bb65095\" />\r\n\r\nThe Qwen team launches Qwen 3.5, and introduces it as such:\r\n\r\n> We are delighted to announce the official release of Qwen3.5, introducing the open-weight of the first model in the Qwen3.5 series, namely Qwen3.5-397B-A17B. As a native vision-language model, Qwen3.5-397B-A17B demonstrates outstanding results across a full range of benchmark evaluations, including reasoning, coding, agent capabilities, and multimodal understanding, empowering developers and enterprises to achieve significantly greater productivity. Built on an innovative hybrid architecture that fuses linear attention (via Gated Delta Networks) with a sparse mixture-of-experts, the model attains remarkable inference efficiency: although it comprises 397 billion total parameters, just 17 billion are activated per forward pass, optimizing both speed and cost without sacrificing capability. We have also expanded our language and dialect support from 119 to 201, providing broader accessibility and enhanced support to users around the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Adding Support for Qwen3.5 (#43830) by @bozheng-hit\r\n\r\n### VibeVoice Acoustic Tokenizer\r\n\r\n<img width=\"821\" height=\"349\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1433597-b43b-4d2d-a2c7-216d7792b8c9\" />\r\n\r\n[VibeVoice](https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.19205) is a novel framework for synthesizing high-fidelity, long-form speech with multiple speakers by employing a next-token diffusion approach within a Large Language Model (LLM) structure. It's designed to capture the authentic conversational \"vibe\" and is particularly suited for generating audio content like podcasts and multi-participant audiobooks.\r\n\r\nOne key feature of VibeVoice is the use of two continuous audio tokenizers, one for extracting acoustic features and another for semantic features.\r\n\r\n* Add VibeVoice Acoustic Tokenizer (#43400) by @ebezzam\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n\r\n* :rotating_light: [`Attn`] New attn mask interface everywhere (#42848)\r\n* :rotating_light: Modify ModernBERT's default attention implementation to stop using FA (#43764)\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes and improvements\r\n\r\n* [docs] deploying (#43241) by @stevhliu\r\n* [Trainer] Move NEFTune impl to standalone functions (#43714) by @SunMarc\r\n* Fix `convert_rope_params_to_dict` so it uses `rope_theta` from the config (#43766) by @hmellor\r\n* Bump dev version (#43777) by @qgallouedec\r\n* Improved `AGENTS.md` (#43763) by @tarekziade\r\n* Fix-release-ubild (#43773) by @ArthurZucker\r\n* unpin torch for CircleCI (#43790) by @ydshieh\r\n* [`Modular Dependencies`] Fixup qwen rms norms (#43772) by @vasqu\r\n* fix(testing): Fix BLOOM tokenizer, CLAP audio features, and CLVP text tester usage in tests (#43798) by @harshaljanjani\r\n* Remove unconditional train_batch_size assignment (#43770) by @lordaarush\r\n* [`Repo Consistency`] Fix rms norm (#43803) by @vasqu\r\n* fix: Prevent AutoTokenizer type mismatch from directory name substrin… (#43791) by @tarekziade\r\n* Refactor trainer data_collator and callbacks tests (#43776) by @SunMarc\r\n* [core] Faster and thread-safe `check_model_inputs` implementation (#43765) by @Cyrilvallez\r\n* [Trainer] use deepspeed SP process group when Accelerate doesn’t build a mesh (#43799) by @kashif\r\n* fix(flaky): enforce manual seed to reduce flakiness (#43794) by @tarekziade\r\n* Add TRL CI bot workflow to trigger tests on PR comments (#43809) by @qgallouedec\r\n* Fix DeepSpeed model preparation logic in Trainer class (#43780) by @qgallouedec\r\n* [docs] reveal more in toctree (#43808) by @stevhliu\r\n* Fix markdown documentation (#43076) by @cyyever\r\n* Fix slack-report workflow file (#43851) by @ydshieh\r\n* add `do_sample=False` to qwen2_5_vl model tests to stablize the output (#43728) by @kaixuanliu\r\n* Fix incorrect timestamp calculation in Qwen3VL Processor (#43659) by @jonathan-fulton\r\n* Remove GPU tracking from TrackioCallback and remove env var support (#43371) by @qgallouedec\r\n* Add id and resume support to SwanLab integration (#43719) by @i-pj\r\n* fix gptoss crash in tp (#43853) by @sywangyi\r\n* Delete batch_split from EncoderDecoderCache (#43814) by @cyyever\r\n* delete unnecessary code to make moe compatible to full graph compile (#43855) by @kaixuanliu\r\n* Update ModelType for Unigram tokenizer (#43860) by @pavel-esir\r\n* [docs] Remove pipeline() examples from summarization/translation tasks (#43831) by @Mr-Neutr0n\r\n* Fix video interpolation in pe_audio_video (#43811) by @Rocketknight1\r\n* Look for the pad_token_id in the right place for Llama4 (#43539) by @Rocketknight1\r\n* Fix cardinality error for DETR models without explicit background class (#43513) by @heathdutton\r\n* docs: Add Switch Transformers docstring notes and update spectrogram comment (#43336) by @harshaljanjani\r\n* [xLSTM] Fix bugs preventing small model training (#43209) by @Anri-Lombard\r\n* docs: correct typo 'neccessary' to 'necessary' (#43868) by @thecaptain789\r\n* Improve PR comment CI feedback  (#43852) by @ydshieh\r\n* Fix init weights in remote code (#43768) by @zucchini-nlp\r\n* Fix GlmMoeDsaConfig default mlp_layer_types in modular conversion (#43876) by @OiPunk\r\n* [MistralCommonBackend] fix loading proc (#43887) by @eustlb\r\n* [`Jamba`] Fallback to slow path and warn instead of error out (#43889) by @vasqu\r\n* Fix SwanLab callback to forward resume init args (#43848) by @OiPunk\r\n* Fix old tech stack in doc (#43879) by @cyyever\r\n* Update TrainingArguments (#43806) by @SunMarc\r\n* Remove unnecessary code or checks for PT 2.4+ (#43787) by @cyyever\r\n* Make it possible to evaluate when using sequence parallel in HF Trainer (#43517) by @jp1924\r\n* [Trainer] Move optimizer cls init to trainer_optimizer.py (#43738) by @SunMarc\r\n* fix the error of tests/quantization/fbgemm_fp8/test_fbgemm_fp8.py::Fb… (#43547) by @sywangyi\r\n* fix fbgemm fp8 multi-device load failure.

Built using a Mixture-of-Experts architecture, K-EXAONE features 236 billion total parameters, with 23 billion active during inference. Performance evaluations across various benchmarks demonstrate that K-EXAONE excels in reasoning, agentic capabilities, general knowledge, multilingual understanding, and long-context processing.\r\n\r\n* Add EXAONE-MoE implementations (#43080) by @nuxlear\r\n\r\n### PP-DocLayoutV3\r\n\r\n<img width=\"6252\" height=\"1892\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2e58244-8ed3-42c6-80d7-e32842977ddb\" />\r\n\r\n**PP-DocLayoutV3** is a unified and high-efficiency model designed for comprehensive layout analysis. It addresses the challenges of complex physical distortions—such as skewing, curving, and adverse lighting—by integrating instance segmentation and reading order prediction into a single, end-to-end framework.\r\n\r\n* [Model] Add PP-DocLayoutV3 Model Support (#43098) by @zhang-prog\r\n\r\n### Youtu-LLM\r\n\r\n<img width=\"564\" height=\"352\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/864372be-4ecb-41fd-8c92-f3515be040d3\" />\r\n\r\nYoutu-LLM is a new, small, yet powerful LLM, contains only 1.96B parameters, supports 128k long context, and has native agentic talents. On general evaluations, Youtu-LLM significantly outperforms SOTA LLMs of similar size in terms of Commonsense, STEM, Coding and Long Context capabilities; in agent-related testing, Youtu-LLM surpasses larger-sized leaders and is truly capable of completing multiple end2end agent tasks. \r\n\r\n  * Add Youtu-LLM model (#43166) by @LuJunru\r\n\r\n### GlmOcr\r\n\r\n<img width=\"3972\" height=\"2352\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7ddfb4f-42ea-4dc6-bc73-aefb0f750c4e\" />\r\n\r\nGLM-OCR is a multimodal OCR model for complex document understanding, built on the GLM-V encoder–decoder architecture. It introduces Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) loss and stable full-task reinforcement learning to improve training efficiency, recognition accuracy, and generalization. The model integrates the CogViT visual encoder pre-trained on large-scale image–text data, a lightweight cross-modal connector with efficient token downsampling, and a GLM-0.5B language decoder. Combined with a two-stage pipeline of layout analysis and parallel recognition based on PP-DocLayout-V3, GLM-OCR delivers robust and high-quality OCR performance across diverse document layouts.\r\n\r\n* [GLM-OCR] GLM-OCR Support (#43391)by @zRzRzRzRzRzRzR\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n\r\n* 🚨 T5Gemma2 model structure (#43633) - Makes sure that the attn implementation is set to all sub-configs. The config.encoder.text_config was not getting its attn set because we aren't passing it to PreTrainedModel.__init__. We can't change the model structure without breaking so I manually re-added a call to self.adjust_attn_implemetation in modeling code\r\n\r\n* 🚨 Generation cache preparation (#43679) - Refactors cache initialization in generation to ensure sliding window configurations are now properly respected. Previously, some models (like Afmoe) created caches without passing the model config, causing sliding window limits to be ignored. This is breaking because models with sliding window attention will now enforce their window size limits during generation, which may change generation behavior or require adjusting sequence lengths in existing code.\r\n\r\n* 🚨 Delete duplicate code in backbone utils (#43323) - This PR cleans up backbone utilities. Specifically, we have currently 5 different config attr to decide which backbone to load, most of which can be merged into one and seem redundant\r\nAfter this PR, we'll have only one config.backbone_config as a single source of truth. The models will load the backbone from_config and load pretrained weights only if the checkpoint has any weights saved. The overall idea is same as in other composite models. A few config arguments are removed as a result.\r\n\r\n* 🚨 Refactor DETR to updated standards (#41549) - standardizes the DETR model to be closer to other vision models in the library.\r\n\r\n* 🚨Fix floating-point precision in JanusImageProcessor resize (#43187) - replaces an `int()` with `round()`, expect light numerical differences \r\n\r\n* 🚨 Remove deprecated AnnotionFormat (#42983) - removes a missnamed class in favour of `AnnotationFormat`. \r\n\r\n## Bugfixes and improvements\r\n\r\n* fix(models): Migrate legacy segmentation_indices to out_indices in BeitConfig (#43505) by @harshaljanjani\r\n* [docs] Update torch version (#42135) by @stevhliu\r\n* Remove SDPA workarounds for torch 2.4+ (#43754) by @cyyever\r\n* add use_deterministic to guarantee the consistency for youtu-llm model (#43759) by @kaixuanliu\r\n* fix: add compatible_model_types to suppress model type mismatch warnings (#43495) by @leoneperdigao\r\n* Fix T5 v1.1 detection (#43681) by @githubnemo\r\n* Add moonshine streaming (#43702) by @eustlb\r\n* Allow bi-directional attention for all models (#43705) by @Cyrilvallez\r\n* Docs: fix Training step by removing tokenizer from trainer initialization (#43733) by @nesjett\r\n* Fix scheduler initialization order (#43711) by @SunMarc\r\n* Fix accelerate integration import  (#43732) by @SunMarc\r\n* Update torch minimum version to 2.4 (#41307) by @cyyever\r\n* Fix dtype in image-text-to-text pipe (#43731) by @zucchini-nlp\r\n* Preventing initialization of siglip's lecun_normal_, default_flax_embed_init in ZeRO3 (#43574) by @jp1924\r\n* fix: AttributeError for Qwen3_omni_moe (#43593) by @Vallabh-1504\r\n* Improve typing/explanations for general model properties (#43712) by @Cyrilvallez\r\n* [Kernels] kernel migration updates for activation kernels (#43518) by @ariG23498\r\n* [`feat`] Allow loading T5Gemma2Encoder with AutoModel (#43559) by @tomaarsen\r\n* Added S110 - try-except-pass rule (#43687) by @tarekziade\r\n* [docs] benchmarks (#43694) by @stevhliu\r\n* fix norm_eps dtype (#43669) by @fschlatt\r\n* Llava onevision: output align for tests and add `image_sizes` input param (#43678) by @kaixuanliu\r\n* Fix CLIPOutput attentions not being returned (#43657) by @jonathan-fulton\r\n* [`Attn`] Fixup interface usage after refactor (#43706) by @vasqu\r\n* Fix model/processor mismatch in SigLIP2 quantization example (#43652) by @jonathan-fulton\r\n* Fix crash of custom models in Notebook or Repl (#43690) by @Cyrilvallez\r\n* Simplify TrainingArguments docstring (#43568) by @SunMarc\r\n* Composite model inherit automatically all important properties from their children (#43691) by @Cyrilvallez\r\n* Update configuration_qwen3.py (#43703) by @francesco-bertolotti\r\n* fix gptoss tp crash (#43695) by @sywangyi\r\n* [CB] Keep order of incoming requests (#43626) by @remi-or\r\n* Fix Apertus model loading (NotImplementedError: Cannot copy out of meta tensor; no data!)

We&#x27;re an open-source, privacy-first alternative to the AI browsers from big labs.<p>The big differentiator: on BrowserOS you can use local LLMs or BYOK and run the agent entirely on the client side, so your company&#x2F;sensitive data stays on your machine!<p>Today we&#x27;re launching filesystem access... just like Claude Cowork, our browser agent can read files, write files, run shell commands! But honestly, we didn&#x27;t plan for this. It turns out the privacy decision we made 9 months ago accidentally positioned us for this moment.<p>The architectural bet we made 9 months ago: Unlike other AI browsers (ChatGPT Atlas, Perplexity Comet) where the agent loop runs server-side, we decided early on to run our agent entirely on your machine (client side).<p>But building everything on the client side wasn&#x27;t smooth. We initially built our agent loop inside a Chrome extension. But we kept hitting walls -- service worker being single thread JS; not having access to NodeJS libraries. So we made the hard decision 2 months ago to throw away everything and start from scratch.<p>In the new architecture, our agent loop sits in a standalone binary that we ship alongside our Chromium. And we use gemini-cli for the agent loop with some tweaks! We wrote a neat adapter to translate between Gemini format and Vercel AI SDK format. You can look at our entire codebase here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.new&#x2F;browseros-agent\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.new&#x2F;browseros-agent</a><p>How we give browser access to filesystem: When Claude Cowork launched, we realized something: because Atlas and Comet run their agent loop server-side, there&#x27;s no good way for their agent to access your files without uploading them to the server first. But our agent was already local. Adding filesystem access meant just... opening the door (with your permissions ofc). Our agent can now read and write files just like Claude Code.<p>What you can actually do today:<p>a) Organize files in my desktop folder <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;NOZ7xjto6Uc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;NOZ7xjto6Uc</a><p>b) Open top 5 HN links, extract the details and write summary into a HTML file <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;uXvqs_TCmMQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;uXvqs_TCmMQ</a><p>--- Where we are now\nIf you haven&#x27;t tried us since the last Show HN (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=44523409\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=44523409</a>), give us another shot. The new architecture unlocked a ton of new features, and we&#x27;ve grown to 8.5K GitHub stars and 100K+ downloads:<p>c) You can now build more reliable workflows using n8n-like graph <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;H_bFfWIevSY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;H_bFfWIevSY</a><p>d) You can also use BrowserOS as an MCP server in Cursor or Claude Code <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;5nevh00lckM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;5nevh00lckM</a><p>We are very bullish on browser being the right platform for a Claude Cowork like agent. Browser is the most commonly used app by knowledge workers (emails, docs, spreadsheets, research, etc). And even Anthropic recognizes this -- for Claude Cowork, they have janky integration with browser via a chrome extension. But owning the entire stack allows us to build differentiated features that wouldn&#x27;t be possible otherwise. Ex:  Browser ACLs.<p>Agents can do dumb or destructive things, so we&#x27;re adding browser-level guardrails (think IAM for agents): &quot;role(agent): can never click buy&quot; or &quot;role(agent): read-only access on my bank&#x27;s homepage.&quot;<p>Curious to hear your take on this and the overall thesis.<p>We’ll be in the comments.

But I didn&#x27;t build Solveig with a single kind of use case in mind.<p>---<p>So it&#x27;s yet another LLM-in-my-terminal?<p>Sort of. Solveig tries to do a few things that other tools don&#x27;t, and to do the shared features with clearer UX, explicit consent, and deeper configuration. It&#x27;s not an IDE extension, doesn&#x27;t require a GUI, and it&#x27;s not built for a specific user type or scenario.<p>At the same time, Solveig&#x27;s competitors are mature projects with real user testing that you should check out. I&#x27;ve written a detailed comparison (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FSilveiraa&#x2F;solveig&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;docs&#x2F;comparison.md\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FSilveiraa&#x2F;solveig&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;docs&#x2F;compari...</a>) to similar tools in the market in the docs.<p>---<p>UPCOMING<p>I have a Roadmap (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FSilveiraa&#x2F;solveig&#x2F;discussions&#x2F;2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FSilveiraa&#x2F;solveig&#x2F;discussions&#x2F;2</a>) available, and feel free to suggest new features or improvements. I&#x27;ve recently added user-defined system prompt templates, and now I&#x27;m working on adding token counting from API messages instead of relying on encoders.<p>---<p>A cool aspect of this project is that I can use Solveig to analyze and improve its own code itself, which also gives me a lot of exposure to its actual usability.<p>I appreciate any feedback or comment, especially anyone who can try out Solveig using Anthropic or Gemini APIs. Tell me if it helped you do something or what stopped you from using it properly in your specific case. Even if you can&#x27;t see how Solveig could help you let me know, that&#x27;s an issue with me communicating value that I need to fix.<p>Leaving a star on the repository (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FSilveiraa&#x2F;solveig\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FSilveiraa&#x2F;solveig</a>) is also very much appreciated.",
