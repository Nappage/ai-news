One of its best features is the ability to sync your usage across devices, giving you a complete picture over different time periods. It respects your privacy by only collecting aggregated usage data. No conversation or code details are ever touched.<p>There has been some controversy around tracking usage and whether it might lead to price hikes or limits, but honestly, Anthropic probably already knows this data. The app is more about helping you optimise your workflow, not exposing anything sensitive. It also includes a ranking system so you can get a sense of how others are using Claude Code and maybe learn from their patterns.<p>I built it with a solid backend architecture to be scalable and responsive, running on a small Kubernetes cluster. The goal is to help people like us understand and improve how we work with Claude Code, all wrapped up in a simple web and CLI interface.",

It was mostly an experiment to learn about CTFs, MCP servers, Kali Linux, Claude Code, and really just how far LLMs can go in a given domain.<p>It&#x27;s basically just an MCP server (for integrating with the CTF server APIs, providing notes, and a few other niceties) paired with a Kali Linux-based Docker image that has Claude Code installed, plus a custom slash command [1] to tie it all together.<p>It performed admirably during the CTF I tried it on, it was able to zero-shot solve maybe 10 or so of the simpler challenges, and provided substantial assistance on another 5 or 6 before getting stuck. It didn&#x27;t stand a chance against the hardest challenges.<p>This was the first CTF I&#x27;ve participated in, and it was an absolute blast. I can imagine some people feeling that LLMs take the fun out of CTFs, but I think the &quot;centaur&quot; [2] aspect of human-LLM interactions is both powerful and effective, given the right infrastructure and UX.<p>Happy to answer any questions people have about the project!<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.anthropic.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;docs&#x2F;claude-code&#x2F;slash-commands#custom-slash-commands\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.anthropic.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;docs&#x2F;claude-code&#x2F;slash-command...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Advanced_chess\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Advanced_chess</a>",

This tag is a tagged version of the `main` branch and does not follow semantic versioning. This model will be included in the next minor release: `v4.54.0`.\r\n\r\n## ModernBERT Decoder\r\n\r\nModernBERT Decoder is the same architecture as [ModernBERT](https://huggingface.co/papers/2412.13663) but trained from scratch with a causal language modeling (CLM) objective. This allows for using the same architecture for comparing encoders and decoders. This is the decoder architecture implementation of ModernBERT, designed for autoregressive text generation tasks.\r\n\r\nLike the encoder version, ModernBERT Decoder incorporates modern architectural improvements such as rotary positional embeddings to support sequences of up to 8192 tokens, unpadding to avoid wasting compute on padding tokens, GeGLU layers, and alternating attention patterns. However, it uses causal (unidirectional) attention to enable autoregressive generation.\r\n\r\n## Usage example\r\n\r\nModernBERT Decoder can be found on the [Huggingface Hub](https://huggingface.co/models?other=modernbert-decoder).\r\n\r\nUsing `pipeline`:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nimport torch\r\nfrom transformers import pipeline\r\n\r\ngenerator = pipeline(\r\n    task=\"text-generation\",\r\n    model=\"blab-jhu/test-32m-dec\",\r\n    torch_dtype=torch.float16,\r\n    device=0\r\n)\r\ngenerator(\"The future of artificial intelligence is\", max_length=50, num_return_sequences=1)\r\n\r\n# For sequence classification\r\nclassifier = pipeline(\r\n    task=\"text-classification\",\r\n    model=\"blab-jhu/test-32m-dec\",\r\n    torch_dtype=torch.float16,\r\n    device=0\r\n)\r\nclassifier(\"This movie is really great!\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing `AutoModel`:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nimport torch\r\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\r\n\r\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"blab-jhu/test-32m-dec\")\r\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\r\n    \"blab-jhu/test-32m-dec\",\r\n    torch_dtype=torch.float16,\r\n    device_map=\"auto\",\r\n)\r\n\r\nprompt = \"The future of artificial intelligence is\"\r\ninputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda\")\r\n\r\nwith torch.no_grad():\r\n    outputs = model.generate(\r\n        **inputs,\r\n        max_length=50,\r\n        num_return_sequences=1,\r\n        temperature=0.7,\r\n        do_sample=True,\r\n        pad_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id\r\n    )\r\n\r\ngenerated_text = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)\r\nprint(f\"Generated text: {generated_text}\")\r\n\r\n# For sequence classification\r\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification\r\n\r\nclassifier_model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(\r\n    \"blab-jhu/test-32m-dec\",\r\n    torch_dtype=torch.float16,\r\n    device_map=\"auto\",\r\n    num_labels=2\r\n)\r\n\r\ntext = \"This movie is really great!\"\r\ninputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda\")\r\n\r\nwith torch.no_grad():\r\n    outputs = classifier_model(**inputs)\r\n    predictions = torch.nn.functional.softmax(outputs.logits, dim=-1)\r\n    predicted_class = torch.argmax(predictions, dim=-1)\r\n\r\nprint(f\"Predicted class: {predicted_class.item()}\")\r\nprint(f\"Prediction probabilities: {predictions}\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing the `transformers` CLI:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\necho \"The future of artificial intelligence is\" | transformers run --task text-generation --model your-username/modernbert-decoder-base --device 0\r\n```",

      "content": "I built a collection of professional slash commands for Anthropic&#x27;s Claude Code that provide structured workflows for common software development tasks.<p><pre><code>  These commands are directly inspired by and adapted from Anthropic&#x27;s own claude-code-best-practices (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anthropic.com&#x2F;engineering&#x2F;claude-code-best-practices) documentation, translating their recommendations into executable workflows.\n\n  The suite includes commands for:\n  • Comprehensive code reviews with security and performance analysis\n  • End-to-end feature development with planning, implementation, and testing\n  • Architectural analysis and design pattern assessment\n • Security audits and vulnerability scanning\n  • GitHub issue resolution with root cause analysis\n  • Performance optimization and build improvements\n\n  Each command follows a systematic approach based on Anthropic&#x27;s\n  best practices, breaking complex tasks into manageable steps.\n  Instead of ad-hoc AI interactions, you get consistent, thorough\n   workflows that adapt to any codebase.\n\n  The commands work through Claude Code&#x27;s slash command system -\n  just type `&#x2F;project:code-review` or `&#x2F;project:create-feature\n  user-authentication` and Claude follows the predefined\n  workflow.\n\n  Installation is straightforward with an interactive script that\n   can install project-specific or globally. The commands are\n  fully customizable markdown files, so you can adapt them to\n  your team&#x27;s specific requirements.\n\n</code></pre>\nI hope others find it useful!",
