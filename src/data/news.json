This post explains why fine-tuning is key to resolving tool selection ambiguity (e.g., internal vs. Google search) and achieving ultra-specialization, transforming it into a strict, enterprise-compliant agent. A case study demonstrates the improved logic. It also introduces the \"FunctionGemma Tuning Lab,\" a no-code demo on Hugging Face Spaces, which streamlines the entire fine-tuning process for developers.",

      "content": "Hi HN,<p>Happy to share the project I&#x27;ve been vibe-coding on for past few months.\nThe Problem: Like many people, I often found myself staring at a fridge full of random ingredients (some about to expire) with no idea what to cook. I was tired of food waste and the repetitive cycle of making the same few meals. I wanted a way to creatively use what I already had.<p>The Solution: So, I decided to build Chefiniti. It&#x27;s an iOS app that acts as a personal AI chef. The core idea is to turn your available food into delicious, custom recipes. I know there are already tons of apps like it but this one is mine :)<p>Here&#x27;s what it can do:\n* Scan Ingredients: Take photos of your fridge or pantry, and the app&#x27;s vision model identifies the ingredients.\n* &quot;Recipefy&quot; a Dish: See a meal you like online or in a restaurant? Snap a photo, and the app generates a recipe to help you recreate it.\n* Generate from Prompt: Just describe what you&#x27;re in the mood for (e.g., &quot;a spicy, gluten-free pasta dish&quot;), and it will create a recipe from scratch.\n* Import from URL: Paste a link from a recipe website to import it into your cookbook.<p>You can also save all these recipes, create shopping lists, and set detailed preferences for diet, allergies, cuisine, and even the cookware you own.\nApp is in a freemium model, within limits you can really test out core features without any payment or even account creation.<p>The Tech Stack: For those interested, the app is built with:\n* Frontend: React Native (with Expo)\n* Backend: Firebase Functions for the API layer.\n* Database &amp; Storage: Firestore and Firebase Cloud Storage.\n* AI: Google&#x27;s Gemini API for recipe generation and analysis.\n* Image Generation: DeepInfra API (for Stable Diffusion).\n* Subscriptions: RevenueCat.<p>I&#x27;ve just launched on the App Store and would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, thoughts, or questions you might have.<p>You can check it out here: \n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chefiniti.app\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chefiniti.app</a>\nOr download directly\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;chefiniti-smart-recipe-creator&#x2F;id6745801080\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;chefiniti-smart-recipe-creator...</a>\nThanks for taking a look!",

      "content": "## What's changed\n\n- Added `showTurnDuration` setting to hide turn duration messages (e.g., \"Cooked for 1m 6s\")\n- Added ability to provide feedback when accepting permission prompts\n- Added inline display of agent's final response in task notifications, making it easier to see results without reading the full transcript file\n- Fixed security vulnerability where wildcard permission rules could match compound commands containing shell operators\n- Fixed false \"file modified\" errors on Windows when cloud sync tools, antivirus scanners, or Git touch file timestamps without changing content\n- Fixed orphaned tool_result errors when sibling tools fail during streaming execution\n- Fixed context window blocking limit being calculated using the full context window instead of the effective context window (which reserves space for max output tokens)\n- Fixed spinner briefly flashing when running local slash commands like `/model` or `/theme`\n- Fixed terminal title animation jitter by using fixed-width braille characters\n- Fixed plugins with git submodules not being fully initialized when installed\n- Fixed bash commands failing on Windows when temp directory paths contained characters like `t` or `n` that were misinterpreted as escape sequences\n- Improved typing responsiveness by reducing memory allocation overhead in terminal rendering\n- Enabled MCP tool search auto mode by default for all users. When MCP tool descriptions exceed 10% of the context window, they are automatically deferred and discovered via the MCPSearch tool instead of being loaded upfront. This reduces context usage for users with many MCP tools configured. Users can disable this by adding `MCPSearch` to `disallowedTools` in their settings.\n- Changed OAuth and API Console URLs from console.anthropic.com to platform.claude.com\n- [VSCode] Fixed `claudeProcessWrapper` setting passing the wrapper path instead of the Claude binary path\n",
