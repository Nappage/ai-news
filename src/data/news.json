It respects your privacy by only collecting aggregated usage data. No conversation or code details are ever touched.<p>There has been some controversy around tracking usage and whether it might lead to price hikes or limits, but honestly, Anthropic probably already knows this data. The app is more about helping you optimise your workflow, not exposing anything sensitive. It also includes a ranking system so you can get a sense of how others are using Claude Code and maybe learn from their patterns.<p>I built it with a solid backend architecture to be scalable and responsive, running on a small Kubernetes cluster.

      "content": "Hey HN,<p>A bit of backstory: I was job hunting for months, applying everywhere and racking up a ton of rejections. It got frustrating, so I decided to flip the script and build something useful instead: an open-source take on Cluely, that popular stealth AI tool from the $15M company. I figured why not recreate something that&#x27;s already out there and buzzing, but make it free, transparent, and way better for privacy. Plus, it felt like a fun challenge.<p>This is actually my first project ever using Tauri, and I&#x27;m hooked. I started out trying Electron, but it just wasn&#x27;t cutting it for something that needs to be fast and reliable - Electron apps end up bloated with all that browser overhead, sucking up RAM and starting slow, which kills the whole &quot;instant access&quot; vibe I was going for. Tauri, with its Rust core, keeps things lean and snappy without any of that extra weight.\nAnyway, Pluely is a super lightweight desktop app, just ~10MB (that&#x27;s 27 times smaller than Cluely), designed to give you real-time AI help during video calls, interviews, sales talks, or pretty much any chat, all without anyone spotting it and without real-time meeting transcription(can add it based on the response).<p>Here&#x27;s what makes it tick:\nAn undetectable overlay: It&#x27;s a see-through window that floats over any app like Zoom or Teams, and it stays hidden in screen shares, recordings, or screenshots.\nSupport for multiple LLMs: Hooks up to OpenAI models like GPT-4, Anthropic&#x27;s Claude, Google Gemini, or xAI Grok. It pulls the models dynamically, and everything runs off your own API keys stored right on your device - no servers or middlemen.\nFlexible inputs: Type stuff in, speak naturally (using Whisper for speech-to-text and voice detection so it just picks up when you talk), or toss in images and screenshots for the AI to break down.<p>Privacy and speed first: All processing is local, it uses half the CPU and RAM of similar tools, built on Tauri plus React. No tracking, no data leaving your machine.\nConversation history: Kept locally so you can pick up where you left off.\nWorks everywhere: Grab it as a .dmg for macOS, .msi for Windows, or .deb for Linux.<p>It&#x27;s killer for stuff like nailing job interviews with discreet tips, debugging code on the spot in tech meetings, or getting strategy nudges during negotiations. Unlike the original Cluely, this one&#x27;s totally free, you can tweak it however you want, and it&#x27;s all out in the open.<p>Download now on GitHub releases: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;iamsrikanthnani&#x2F;pluely&#x2F;releases\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;iamsrikanthnani&#x2F;pluely&#x2F;releases</a><p>I&#x27;d love your thoughts, especially on adding custom LLM providers or tweaking the voice detection. What else would you want in a stealth AI sidekick?",
