      "content": "Hi HN,<p>Happy to share the project I&#x27;ve been vibe-coding on for past few months.\nThe Problem: Like many people, I often found myself staring at a fridge full of random ingredients (some about to expire) with no idea what to cook. I was tired of food waste and the repetitive cycle of making the same few meals. I wanted a way to creatively use what I already had.<p>The Solution: So, I decided to build Chefiniti. It&#x27;s an iOS app that acts as a personal AI chef. The core idea is to turn your available food into delicious, custom recipes. I know there are already tons of apps like it but this one is mine :)<p>Here&#x27;s what it can do:\n* Scan Ingredients: Take photos of your fridge or pantry, and the app&#x27;s vision model identifies the ingredients.\n* &quot;Recipefy&quot; a Dish: See a meal you like online or in a restaurant? Snap a photo, and the app generates a recipe to help you recreate it.\n* Generate from Prompt: Just describe what you&#x27;re in the mood for (e.g., &quot;a spicy, gluten-free pasta dish&quot;), and it will create a recipe from scratch.\n* Import from URL: Paste a link from a recipe website to import it into your cookbook.<p>You can also save all these recipes, create shopping lists, and set detailed preferences for diet, allergies, cuisine, and even the cookware you own.\nApp is in a freemium model, within limits you can really test out core features without any payment or even account creation.<p>The Tech Stack: For those interested, the app is built with:\n* Frontend: React Native (with Expo)\n* Backend: Firebase Functions for the API layer.\n* Database &amp; Storage: Firestore and Firebase Cloud Storage.\n* AI: Google&#x27;s Gemini API for recipe generation and analysis.\n* Image Generation: DeepInfra API (for Stable Diffusion).\n* Subscriptions: RevenueCat.<p>I&#x27;ve just launched on the App Store and would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, thoughts, or questions you might have.<p>You can check it out here: \n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chefiniti.app\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chefiniti.app</a>\nOr download directly\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;chefiniti-smart-recipe-creator&#x2F;id6745801080\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;chefiniti-smart-recipe-creator...</a>\nThanks for taking a look!",

It introduces Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) loss and stable full-task reinforcement learning to improve training efficiency, recognition accuracy, and generalization. The model integrates the CogViT visual encoder pre-trained on large-scale image–text data, a lightweight cross-modal connector with efficient token downsampling, and a GLM-0.5B language decoder. Combined with a two-stage pipeline of layout analysis and parallel recognition based on PP-DocLayout-V3, GLM-OCR delivers robust and high-quality OCR performance across diverse document layouts.\r\n\r\n* [GLM-OCR] GLM-OCR Support (#43391)by @zRzRzRzRzRzRzR\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n\r\n* 🚨 T5Gemma2 model structure (#43633) - Makes sure that the attn implementation is set to all sub-configs. The config.encoder.text_config was not getting its attn set because we aren't passing it to PreTrainedModel.__init__. We can't change the model structure without breaking so I manually re-added a call to self.adjust_attn_implemetation in modeling code\r\n\r\n* 🚨 Generation cache preparation (#43679) - Refactors cache initialization in generation to ensure sliding window configurations are now properly respected. Previously, some models (like Afmoe) created caches without passing the model config, causing sliding window limits to be ignored. This is breaking because models with sliding window attention will now enforce their window size limits during generation, which may change generation behavior or require adjusting sequence lengths in existing code.\r\n\r\n* 🚨 Delete duplicate code in backbone utils (#43323) - This PR cleans up backbone utilities. Specifically, we have currently 5 different config attr to decide which backbone to load, most of which can be merged into one and seem redundant\r\nAfter this PR, we'll have only one config.backbone_config as a single source of truth. The models will load the backbone from_config and load pretrained weights only if the checkpoint has any weights saved. The overall idea is same as in other composite models. A few config arguments are removed as a result.\r\n\r\n* 🚨 Refactor DETR to updated standards (#41549) - standardizes the DETR model to be closer to other vision models in the library.\r\n\r\n* 🚨Fix floating-point precision in JanusImageProcessor resize (#43187) - replaces an `int()` with `round()`, expect light numerical differences \r\n\r\n* 🚨 Remove deprecated AnnotionFormat (#42983) - removes a missnamed class in favour of `AnnotationFormat`. \r\n\r\n## Bugfixes and improvements\r\n\r\n* fix(models): Migrate legacy segmentation_indices to out_indices in BeitConfig (#43505) by @harshaljanjani\r\n* [docs] Update torch version (#42135) by @stevhliu\r\n* Remove SDPA workarounds for torch 2.4+ (#43754) by @cyyever\r\n* add use_deterministic to guarantee the consistency for youtu-llm model (#43759) by @kaixuanliu\r\n* fix: add compatible_model_types to suppress model type mismatch warnings (#43495) by @leoneperdigao\r\n* Fix T5 v1.1 detection (#43681) by @githubnemo\r\n* Add moonshine streaming (#43702) by @eustlb\r\n* Allow bi-directional attention for all models (#43705) by @Cyrilvallez\r\n* Docs: fix Training step by removing tokenizer from trainer initialization (#43733) by @nesjett\r\n* Fix scheduler initialization order (#43711) by @SunMarc\r\n* Fix accelerate integration import  (#43732) by @SunMarc\r\n* Update torch minimum version to 2.4 (#41307) by @cyyever\r\n* Fix dtype in image-text-to-text pipe (#43731) by @zucchini-nlp\r\n* Preventing initialization of siglip's lecun_normal_, default_flax_embed_init in ZeRO3 (#43574) by @jp1924\r\n* fix: AttributeError for Qwen3_omni_moe (#43593) by @Vallabh-1504\r\n* Improve typing/explanations for general model properties (#43712) by @Cyrilvallez\r\n* [Kernels] kernel migration updates for activation kernels (#43518) by @ariG23498\r\n* [`feat`] Allow loading T5Gemma2Encoder with AutoModel (#43559) by @tomaarsen\r\n* Added S110 - try-except-pass rule (#43687) by @tarekziade\r\n* [docs] benchmarks (#43694) by @stevhliu\r\n* fix norm_eps dtype (#43669) by @fschlatt\r\n* Llava onevision: output align for tests and add `image_sizes` input param (#43678) by @kaixuanliu\r\n* Fix CLIPOutput attentions not being returned (#43657) by @jonathan-fulton\r\n* [`Attn`] Fixup interface usage after refactor (#43706) by @vasqu\r\n* Fix model/processor mismatch in SigLIP2 quantization example (#43652) by @jonathan-fulton\r\n* Fix crash of custom models in Notebook or Repl (#43690) by @Cyrilvallez\r\n* Simplify TrainingArguments docstring (#43568) by @SunMarc\r\n* Composite model inherit automatically all important properties from their children (#43691) by @Cyrilvallez\r\n* Update configuration_qwen3.py (#43703) by @francesco-bertolotti\r\n* fix gptoss tp crash (#43695) by @sywangyi\r\n* [CB] Keep order of incoming requests (#43626) by @remi-or\r\n* Fix Apertus model loading (NotImplementedError: Cannot copy out of meta tensor; no data!)
