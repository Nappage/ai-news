      "content": "Hi HN,<p>Happy to share the project I&#x27;ve been vibe-coding on for past few months.\nThe Problem: Like many people, I often found myself staring at a fridge full of random ingredients (some about to expire) with no idea what to cook. I was tired of food waste and the repetitive cycle of making the same few meals. I wanted a way to creatively use what I already had.<p>The Solution: So, I decided to build Chefiniti. It&#x27;s an iOS app that acts as a personal AI chef. The core idea is to turn your available food into delicious, custom recipes. I know there are already tons of apps like it but this one is mine :)<p>Here&#x27;s what it can do:\n* Scan Ingredients: Take photos of your fridge or pantry, and the app&#x27;s vision model identifies the ingredients.\n* &quot;Recipefy&quot; a Dish: See a meal you like online or in a restaurant? Snap a photo, and the app generates a recipe to help you recreate it.\n* Generate from Prompt: Just describe what you&#x27;re in the mood for (e.g., &quot;a spicy, gluten-free pasta dish&quot;), and it will create a recipe from scratch.\n* Import from URL: Paste a link from a recipe website to import it into your cookbook.<p>You can also save all these recipes, create shopping lists, and set detailed preferences for diet, allergies, cuisine, and even the cookware you own.\nApp is in a freemium model, within limits you can really test out core features without any payment or even account creation.<p>The Tech Stack: For those interested, the app is built with:\n* Frontend: React Native (with Expo)\n* Backend: Firebase Functions for the API layer.\n* Database &amp; Storage: Firestore and Firebase Cloud Storage.\n* AI: Google&#x27;s Gemini API for recipe generation and analysis.\n* Image Generation: DeepInfra API (for Stable Diffusion).\n* Subscriptions: RevenueCat.<p>I&#x27;ve just launched on the App Store and would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, thoughts, or questions you might have.<p>You can check it out here: \n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chefiniti.app\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chefiniti.app</a>\nOr download directly\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;chefiniti-smart-recipe-creator&#x2F;id6745801080\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;chefiniti-smart-recipe-creator...</a>\nThanks for taking a look!",

File operations prioritized, and shell commands can be disabled.<p>Plugin Architecture - Extend capabilities through drop-in plugins. Add SQL queries, web scraping or block dangerous commands with 100 lines of Python.<p>Modern CLI - Clear interface with task planning and listing, file content previews, diff editing, API usage tracking, code linting, waiting animations and rich tree displays for informed user decisions.<p>Provider Independence - Works with any OpenAI-compatible API, including local models.<p>tl;dr: similar idea to Claude Code (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;claude.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;claude-code\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;claude.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;claude-code</a>) or Aider (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aider.chat&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aider.chat&#x2F;</a>), focusing on providing explicit user consent, granular configuration, drop-in plugins and the ability to integrate any model, backend or API.<p>See the Features for more: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FSilveiraa&#x2F;solveig&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;docs&#x2F;about.md#features-and-principles\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FSilveiraa&#x2F;solveig&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;docs&#x2F;about.m...</a><p>---<p>TYPICAL TASKS<p>- &quot;Find and list all the duplicate files inside ~&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;&quot;\n- &quot;Check my essay Final.docx for spelling, syntax or factual errors while maintaining the tone&quot;\n- &quot;Refactor my test_database.ts suite to be more concise&quot;\n- &quot;Try and find out why my computer is slow&quot;\n- &quot;Create a dockerized BlackSheep webapp with a test suite, then build the image and run it locally&quot;<p>---<p>So it&#x27;s a coding assistant?<p>You can use Solveig for analyzing, editing and testing your code, and all of these scenarios have received significant support through development features like code linting. But I didn&#x27;t build Solveig with a single kind of use case in mind.<p>---<p>So it&#x27;s yet another LLM-in-my-terminal?<p>Sort of. Solveig tries to do a few things that other tools don&#x27;t, and to do the shared features with clearer UX, explicit consent, and deeper configuration. It&#x27;s not an IDE extension, doesn&#x27;t require a GUI, and it&#x27;s not built for a specific user type or scenario.<p>At the same time, Solveig&#x27;s competitors are mature projects with real user testing that you should check out. I&#x27;ve written a detailed comparison (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FSilveiraa&#x2F;solveig&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;docs&#x2F;comparison.md\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FSilveiraa&#x2F;solveig&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;docs&#x2F;compari...</a>) to similar tools in the market in the docs.<p>---<p>UPCOMING<p>I have a Roadmap (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FSilveiraa&#x2F;solveig&#x2F;discussions&#x2F;2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FSilveiraa&#x2F;solveig&#x2F;discussions&#x2F;2</a>) available, and feel free to suggest new features or improvements. I&#x27;ve recently added user-defined system prompt templates, and now I&#x27;m working on adding token counting from API messages instead of relying on encoders.<p>---<p>A cool aspect of this project is that I can use Solveig to analyze and improve its own code itself, which also gives me a lot of exposure to its actual usability.<p>I appreciate any feedback or comment, especially anyone who can try out Solveig using Anthropic or Gemini APIs. Tell me if it helped you do something or what stopped you from using it properly in your specific case. Even if you can&#x27;t see how Solveig could help you let me know, that&#x27;s an issue with me communicating value that I need to fix.<p>Leaving a star on the repository (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FSilveiraa&#x2F;solveig\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FSilveiraa&#x2F;solveig</a>) is also very much appreciated.",
