One of its best features is the ability to sync your usage across devices, giving you a complete picture over different time periods. It respects your privacy by only collecting aggregated usage data. No conversation or code details are ever touched.<p>There has been some controversy around tracking usage and whether it might lead to price hikes or limits, but honestly, Anthropic probably already knows this data. The app is more about helping you optimise your workflow, not exposing anything sensitive. It also includes a ranking system so you can get a sense of how others are using Claude Code and maybe learn from their patterns.<p>I built it with a solid backend architecture to be scalable and responsive, running on a small Kubernetes cluster. The goal is to help people like us understand and improve how we work with Claude Code, all wrapped up in a simple web and CLI interface.",

This tag is a tagged version of the `main` branch and does not follow semantic versioning. This model will be included in the next minor release: `v4.57.0`.\r\n\r\n## Vault-Gemma\r\n\r\n[VaultGemma](https://services.google.com/fh/files/blogs/vaultgemma_tech_report.pdf) is a text-only decoder model derived from [Gemma 2](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/gemma2), notably it drops the norms after the Attention and MLP blocks, and uses full attention for all layers instead of alternating between full attention and local sliding attention. VaultGemma is available as a pretrained model with 1B parameters that uses a 1024 token sequence length.\r\n\r\nVaultGemma was trained from scratch with sequence-level differential privacy (DP). Its training data includes the same mixture as the [Gemma 2 models](https://huggingface.co/collections/google/gemma-2-release-667d6600fd5220e7b967f315), consisting of a number of documents of varying lengths. Additionally, it is trained using [DP stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00133) and provides a (ε ≤ 2.0, δ ≤ 1.1e-10)-sequence-level DP guarantee, where a sequence consists of 1024 consecutive tokens extracted from heterogeneous data sources. Specifically, the privacy unit of the guarantee is for the sequences after sampling and packing of the mixture.\r\n\r\nThe example below demonstrates how to chat with the model with `pipeline`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom transformers import pipeline\r\n\r\npipe = pipeline(\r\n    task=\"text-generation\",\r\n    model=\"google/vaultgemma-1b\",\r\n    dtype=\"auto\",\r\n    device_map=\"auto\",\r\n)\r\n\r\ntext = \"Tell me an unknown interesting biology fact about the brain.\"\r\noutputs = pipe(text, max_new_tokens=32)\r\nresponse = outputs[0][\"generated_text\"]\r\nprint(response)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith the `AutoModelForCausalLM` class: \r\n\r\n```python\r\n# pip install accelerate\r\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\r\n\r\nmodel_id = \"google/vaultgemma-1b\"\r\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)\r\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, device_map=\"auto\", dtype=\"auto\")\r\n\r\ntext = \"Tell me an unknown interesting biology fact about the brain.\"\r\ninput_ids = tokenizer(text, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(model.device)\r\n\r\noutputs = model.generate(**input_ids, max_new_tokens=32)\r\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nor with `transformers chat`:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntransformers chat google/vaultgemma-1b\r\n```",

      "content": "Hi, We’ve built Pantheon-CLI, an fully open-source project that aims to be the “Python Claude Code + Notebook” — but designed for data analysis instead of just coding.<p>Unlike most AI coding assistants, Pantheon-CLI runs entirely on your machine (or server). No data upload required. It blends natural language and code in a single workflow, keeping variables in memory and letting you switch seamlessly between typing code and asking in plain English.<p>What it does:\n1. Chat with your data: Directly process CSV, Excel, AnnData, Pickle, Torch tensors, or any format supported by Python&#x2F;R&#x2F;Julia.\n2. Mixed programming: Variables persist across natural language and code; the CLI auto-generates and runs code for you.\n3. MCP-like agent integration: Read&#x2F;create files, run commands, fetch web pages, generate&#x2F;revise code.\n4. Human-like learning: Feed it a PDF paper or tutorial—Pantheon-CLI reads it, plans steps, and replicates methods before analysis.\n5. Task planning: Builds scientific agents by learning from papers&#x2F;tutorials (not just fixed, human-predefined steps).\n6. Multi-model support: Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, DeepSeek, Qwen, etc. + offline local LLMs (ollama, deepseek, gpt-oss).\n7. Multi-RAG support: Pre-learns from docs&#x2F;web into a local “brain” for more credible outputs without massive token costs.\n8. Built-in biology toolsets: For omics analysis (alignment, annotation, differential expression, full paper reproduction).\n9. Notebook mode: Brings the same agentic workflow into Jupyter—automatically runs and revises code, operates on files, and learns from tutorials&#x2F;papers.<p>Pantheon-CLI is our attempt to push beyond “AI writes code for you.” Instead, it’s an agentic operating system for data analysis, spanning both terminal and notebook.<p>Repo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aristoteleo&#x2F;pantheon-cli\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aristoteleo&#x2F;pantheon-cli</a><p>Tutorial: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pantheonos.stanford.edu&#x2F;cli&#x2F;docs&#x2F;intro&#x2F;getting-started\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pantheonos.stanford.edu&#x2F;cli&#x2F;docs&#x2F;intro&#x2F;getting-start...</a><p>Home page: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pantheonos.stanford.edu&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pantheonos.stanford.edu&#x2F;</a><p>Would love to hear feedback from the HN community—what use cases would you try this for, and what features would make it more useful to you?",
