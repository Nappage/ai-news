      "content": "Google AI Edge provides the tools to run AI features on-device, and its new LiteRT-LM runtime is a significant leap forward for generative AI. LiteRT-LM is an open-source C++ API, cross-platform compatibility, and hardware acceleration designed to efficiently run large language models like Gemma and Gemini Nano across a vast range of hardware. Its key innovation is a flexible, modular architecture that can scale to power complex, multi-task features in Chrome and Chromebook Plus, while also being lean enough for resource-constrained devices like the Pixel Watch. This versatility is already enabling a new wave of on-device generative AI, bringing capabilities like WebAI and smart replies to users.",

One of its best features is the ability to sync your usage across devices, giving you a complete picture over different time periods. It respects your privacy by only collecting aggregated usage data. No conversation or code details are ever touched.<p>There has been some controversy around tracking usage and whether it might lead to price hikes or limits, but honestly, Anthropic probably already knows this data. The app is more about helping you optimise your workflow, not exposing anything sensitive. It also includes a ranking system so you can get a sense of how others are using Claude Code and maybe learn from their patterns.<p>I built it with a solid backend architecture to be scalable and responsive, running on a small Kubernetes cluster. The goal is to help people like us understand and improve how we work with Claude Code, all wrapped up in a simple web and CLI interface.",

      "content": "Hi HN,<p>Happy to share the project I&#x27;ve been vibe-coding on for past few months.\nThe Problem: Like many people, I often found myself staring at a fridge full of random ingredients (some about to expire) with no idea what to cook. I was tired of food waste and the repetitive cycle of making the same few meals. I wanted a way to creatively use what I already had.<p>The Solution: So, I decided to build Chefiniti. It&#x27;s an iOS app that acts as a personal AI chef. The core idea is to turn your available food into delicious, custom recipes. I know there are already tons of apps like it but this one is mine :)<p>Here&#x27;s what it can do:\n* Scan Ingredients: Take photos of your fridge or pantry, and the app&#x27;s vision model identifies the ingredients.\n* &quot;Recipefy&quot; a Dish: See a meal you like online or in a restaurant? Snap a photo, and the app generates a recipe to help you recreate it.\n* Generate from Prompt: Just describe what you&#x27;re in the mood for (e.g., &quot;a spicy, gluten-free pasta dish&quot;), and it will create a recipe from scratch.\n* Import from URL: Paste a link from a recipe website to import it into your cookbook.<p>You can also save all these recipes, create shopping lists, and set detailed preferences for diet, allergies, cuisine, and even the cookware you own.\nApp is in a freemium model, within limits you can really test out core features without any payment or even account creation.<p>The Tech Stack: For those interested, the app is built with:\n* Frontend: React Native (with Expo)\n* Backend: Firebase Functions for the API layer.\n* Database &amp; Storage: Firestore and Firebase Cloud Storage.\n* AI: Google&#x27;s Gemini API for recipe generation and analysis.\n* Image Generation: DeepInfra API (for Stable Diffusion).\n* Subscriptions: RevenueCat.<p>I&#x27;ve just launched on the App Store and would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, thoughts, or questions you might have.<p>You can check it out here: \n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chefiniti.app\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chefiniti.app</a>\nOr download directly\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;chefiniti-smart-recipe-creator&#x2F;id6745801080\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;chefiniti-smart-recipe-creator...</a>\nThanks for taking a look!",

This tag is a tagged version of the `main` branch and does not follow semantic versioning. This model will be included in the next minor release: `v4.57.0`.\r\n\r\n## Vault-Gemma\r\n\r\n[VaultGemma](https://services.google.com/fh/files/blogs/vaultgemma_tech_report.pdf) is a text-only decoder model derived from [Gemma 2](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/gemma2), notably it drops the norms after the Attention and MLP blocks, and uses full attention for all layers instead of alternating between full attention and local sliding attention. VaultGemma is available as a pretrained model with 1B parameters that uses a 1024 token sequence length.\r\n\r\nVaultGemma was trained from scratch with sequence-level differential privacy (DP). Its training data includes the same mixture as the [Gemma 2 models](https://huggingface.co/collections/google/gemma-2-release-667d6600fd5220e7b967f315), consisting of a number of documents of varying lengths. Additionally, it is trained using [DP stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00133) and provides a (ε ≤ 2.0, δ ≤ 1.1e-10)-sequence-level DP guarantee, where a sequence consists of 1024 consecutive tokens extracted from heterogeneous data sources. Specifically, the privacy unit of the guarantee is for the sequences after sampling and packing of the mixture.\r\n\r\nThe example below demonstrates how to chat with the model with `pipeline`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom transformers import pipeline\r\n\r\npipe = pipeline(\r\n    task=\"text-generation\",\r\n    model=\"google/vaultgemma-1b\",\r\n    dtype=\"auto\",\r\n    device_map=\"auto\",\r\n)\r\n\r\ntext = \"Tell me an unknown interesting biology fact about the brain.\"\r\noutputs = pipe(text, max_new_tokens=32)\r\nresponse = outputs[0][\"generated_text\"]\r\nprint(response)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith the `AutoModelForCausalLM` class: \r\n\r\n```python\r\n# pip install accelerate\r\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\r\n\r\nmodel_id = \"google/vaultgemma-1b\"\r\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)\r\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, device_map=\"auto\", dtype=\"auto\")\r\n\r\ntext = \"Tell me an unknown interesting biology fact about the brain.\"\r\ninput_ids = tokenizer(text, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(model.device)\r\n\r\noutputs = model.generate(**input_ids, max_new_tokens=32)\r\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nor with `transformers chat`:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntransformers chat google/vaultgemma-1b\r\n```",

No data upload required. It blends natural language and code in a single workflow, keeping variables in memory and letting you switch seamlessly between typing code and asking in plain English.<p>What it does:\n1. Chat with your data: Directly process CSV, Excel, AnnData, Pickle, Torch tensors, or any format supported by Python&#x2F;R&#x2F;Julia.\n2. Mixed programming: Variables persist across natural language and code; the CLI auto-generates and runs code for you.\n3. MCP-like agent integration: Read&#x2F;create files, run commands, fetch web pages, generate&#x2F;revise code.\n4. Human-like learning: Feed it a PDF paper or tutorial—Pantheon-CLI reads it, plans steps, and replicates methods before analysis.\n5. Task planning: Builds scientific agents by learning from papers&#x2F;tutorials (not just fixed, human-predefined steps).\n6. Multi-model support: Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, DeepSeek, Qwen, etc. + offline local LLMs (ollama, deepseek, gpt-oss).\n7. Multi-RAG support: Pre-learns from docs&#x2F;web into a local “brain” for more credible outputs without massive token costs.\n8. Built-in biology toolsets: For omics analysis (alignment, annotation, differential expression, full paper reproduction).\n9. Notebook mode: Brings the same agentic workflow into Jupyter—automatically runs and revises code, operates on files, and learns from tutorials&#x2F;papers.<p>Pantheon-CLI is our attempt to push beyond “AI writes code for you.” Instead, it’s an agentic operating system for data analysis, spanning both terminal and notebook.<p>Repo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aristoteleo&#x2F;pantheon-cli\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aristoteleo&#x2F;pantheon-cli</a><p>Tutorial: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pantheonos.stanford.edu&#x2F;cli&#x2F;docs&#x2F;intro&#x2F;getting-started\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pantheonos.stanford.edu&#x2F;cli&#x2F;docs&#x2F;intro&#x2F;getting-start...</a><p>Home page: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pantheonos.stanford.edu&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pantheonos.stanford.edu&#x2F;</a><p>Would love to hear feedback from the HN community—what use cases would you try this for, and what features would make it more useful to you?",

      "content": "I read about ingesting PDFs in Google Gemini here on HN last week [1]. This and some other thoughts that I had on AI [2] made me want to create a summarize PDF command line utility. Just point the utility to a PDF and get a summary back. However, I personally prefer to write CLI tools in Rust since those binaries are fast, small, and easy to distribute via `cargo install` (or `cargo binstall`). So that was a problem. I wanted to use a cloud provider since my system doesn&#x27;t have enough RAM for most state-of-the-art models, but at the same time, I didn&#x27;t want to require users of the tool to use the same API provider as me.<p>That&#x27;s why I created the `transformrs` Rust library [3]. The name is from &quot;transform&quot;, which is essentially what AI models do, and &quot;Rust&quot;. It is also a nod to the transformers algorithm.<p>To allow for proper testing in CI, I considered to make a mock endpoint that I could run my tests against. However, AI APIs are so cheap nowadays that I figured I could just as well run the tests against the actual endpoints. So that is what currently happens. Locally and in CI I have set up 5 different API keys and I run multiple tests against all of these endpoints, so that&#x27;s about 30 requests each time (tests run in 10 seconds). I change a file or each push to CI. It&#x27;s incredible how stable these endpoints have become. 18 tests check whether the prompt &quot;This is a test. Please respond with &#x27;hello world&#x27;&quot; actually responds with &quot;hello world&quot; and so far &gt;99% of the times it does. CI is way less flaky than I would have expected.<p>In any case, I hope people will find the library useful. I&#x27;m curious for feedback and suggestions.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=42952605\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=42952605</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huijzer.xyz&#x2F;posts&#x2F;ai-learning-rate&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huijzer.xyz&#x2F;posts&#x2F;ai-learning-rate&#x2F;</a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;transformrs&#x2F;transformrs\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;transformrs&#x2F;transformrs</a>",
