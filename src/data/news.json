      "content": "Hi! This app helps you get a clear view of how you are using Claude Code. It shows stats like message counts, token usage, sessions, projects, and even estimates your API costs. One of its best features is the ability to sync your usage across devices, giving you a complete picture over different time periods. It respects your privacy by only collecting aggregated usage data. No conversation or code details are ever touched.<p>There has been some controversy around tracking usage and whether it might lead to price hikes or limits, but honestly, Anthropic probably already knows this data. The app is more about helping you optimise your workflow, not exposing anything sensitive. It also includes a ranking system so you can get a sense of how others are using Claude Code and maybe learn from their patterns.<p>I built it with a solid backend architecture to be scalable and responsive, running on a small Kubernetes cluster. The goal is to help people like us understand and improve how we work with Claude Code, all wrapped up in a simple web and CLI interface.",

It was mostly an experiment to learn about CTFs, MCP servers, Kali Linux, Claude Code, and really just how far LLMs can go in a given domain.<p>It&#x27;s basically just an MCP server (for integrating with the CTF server APIs, providing notes, and a few other niceties) paired with a Kali Linux-based Docker image that has Claude Code installed, plus a custom slash command [1] to tie it all together.<p>It performed admirably during the CTF I tried it on, it was able to zero-shot solve maybe 10 or so of the simpler challenges, and provided substantial assistance on another 5 or 6 before getting stuck. It didn&#x27;t stand a chance against the hardest challenges.<p>This was the first CTF I&#x27;ve participated in, and it was an absolute blast. I can imagine some people feeling that LLMs take the fun out of CTFs, but I think the &quot;centaur&quot; [2] aspect of human-LLM interactions is both powerful and effective, given the right infrastructure and UX.<p>Happy to answer any questions people have about the project!<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.anthropic.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;docs&#x2F;claude-code&#x2F;slash-commands#custom-slash-commands\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.anthropic.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;docs&#x2F;claude-code&#x2F;slash-command...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Advanced_chess\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Advanced_chess</a>",

      "content": "Hi HN,<p>Happy to share the project I&#x27;ve been vibe-coding on for past few months.\nThe Problem: Like many people, I often found myself staring at a fridge full of random ingredients (some about to expire) with no idea what to cook. I was tired of food waste and the repetitive cycle of making the same few meals. I wanted a way to creatively use what I already had.<p>The Solution: So, I decided to build Chefiniti. It&#x27;s an iOS app that acts as a personal AI chef. The core idea is to turn your available food into delicious, custom recipes. I know there are already tons of apps like it but this one is mine :)<p>Here&#x27;s what it can do:\n* Scan Ingredients: Take photos of your fridge or pantry, and the app&#x27;s vision model identifies the ingredients.\n* &quot;Recipefy&quot; a Dish: See a meal you like online or in a restaurant? Snap a photo, and the app generates a recipe to help you recreate it.\n* Generate from Prompt: Just describe what you&#x27;re in the mood for (e.g., &quot;a spicy, gluten-free pasta dish&quot;), and it will create a recipe from scratch.\n* Import from URL: Paste a link from a recipe website to import it into your cookbook.<p>You can also save all these recipes, create shopping lists, and set detailed preferences for diet, allergies, cuisine, and even the cookware you own.\nApp is in a freemium model, within limits you can really test out core features without any payment or even account creation.<p>The Tech Stack: For those interested, the app is built with:\n* Frontend: React Native (with Expo)\n* Backend: Firebase Functions for the API layer.\n* Database &amp; Storage: Firestore and Firebase Cloud Storage.\n* AI: Google&#x27;s Gemini API for recipe generation and analysis.\n* Image Generation: DeepInfra API (for Stable Diffusion).\n* Subscriptions: RevenueCat.<p>I&#x27;ve just launched on the App Store and would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, thoughts, or questions you might have.<p>You can check it out here: \n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chefiniti.app\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chefiniti.app</a>\nOr download directly\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;chefiniti-smart-recipe-creator&#x2F;id6745801080\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;chefiniti-smart-recipe-creator...</a>\nThanks for taking a look!",

This family of models contains multiple different architectures and model sizes. \r\n\r\n### The Dense\r\n\r\nThis model in specific targets the base text model without mixture of experts (moe) with 0.3B parameters in total. It uses the standard [Llama](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/llama.md) at its core.\r\n\r\n### The MoE\r\n\r\nThis model in specific targets the base text model with mixture of experts (moe) - one with 21B total, 3B active parameters and another one with 300B total, 47B active parameters. It uses the standard [Llama](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/llama.md) at its core combined with a specialized MoE based on [Mixtral](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/mixtral.md) with additional shared experts.\r\n\r\n## Usage example\r\n\r\nErnie-4.5 can be found on the [Huggingface Hub](https://huggingface.co/models?other=ernie4_5).\r\n\r\nGenerating text with Ernie:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nimport torch\r\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\r\n\r\nmodel_name = \"baidu/ERNIE-4.5-0.3B-PT\"\r\n\r\n# load the tokenizer and the model\r\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\r\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\r\n    model_name,\r\n    device_map=\"auto\",\r\n    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,\r\n)\r\n\r\n# prepare the model input\r\ninputs = tokenizer(\"Hey, are you conscious? Can you talk to me?\", return_tensors=\"pt\")\r\nprompt = \"Hey, are you conscious? Can you talk to me?\"\r\nmessages = [\r\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\r\n]\r\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\r\n    messages,\r\n    tokenize=False,\r\n    add_generation_prompt=True\r\n)\r\nmodel_inputs = tokenizer([text], add_special_tokens=False, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(model.device)\r\n\r\n# conduct text completion\r\ngenerated_ids = model.generate(\r\n    **model_inputs,\r\n    max_new_tokens=32,\r\n)\r\noutput_ids = generated_ids[0][len(model_inputs.input_ids[0]):].tolist()\r\n\r\n# decode the generated ids\r\ngenerate_text = tokenizer.decode(output_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee below for an example leveraging the MoE variant:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nimport torch\r\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\r\n\r\nmodel_name = \"baidu/ERNIE-4.5-21B-A3B-PT\"\r\n\r\n# load the tokenizer and the model\r\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\r\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\r\n    model_name,\r\n    device_map=\"auto\",\r\n    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,\r\n)\r\n\r\n# prepare the model input\r\ninputs = tokenizer(\"Hey, are you conscious?

The commands are\n  fully customizable markdown files, so you can adapt them to\n  your team&#x27;s specific requirements.\n\n</code></pre>\nI hope others find it useful!",
