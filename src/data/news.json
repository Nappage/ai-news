One of its best features is the ability to sync your usage across devices, giving you a complete picture over different time periods. It respects your privacy by only collecting aggregated usage data. No conversation or code details are ever touched.<p>There has been some controversy around tracking usage and whether it might lead to price hikes or limits, but honestly, Anthropic probably already knows this data. The app is more about helping you optimise your workflow, not exposing anything sensitive. It also includes a ranking system so you can get a sense of how others are using Claude Code and maybe learn from their patterns.<p>I built it with a solid backend architecture to be scalable and responsive, running on a small Kubernetes cluster. The goal is to help people like us understand and improve how we work with Claude Code, all wrapped up in a simple web and CLI interface.",

      "content": "Hi HN,<p>Happy to share the project I&#x27;ve been vibe-coding on for past few months.\nThe Problem: Like many people, I often found myself staring at a fridge full of random ingredients (some about to expire) with no idea what to cook. I was tired of food waste and the repetitive cycle of making the same few meals. I wanted a way to creatively use what I already had.<p>The Solution: So, I decided to build Chefiniti. It&#x27;s an iOS app that acts as a personal AI chef. The core idea is to turn your available food into delicious, custom recipes. I know there are already tons of apps like it but this one is mine :)<p>Here&#x27;s what it can do:\n* Scan Ingredients: Take photos of your fridge or pantry, and the app&#x27;s vision model identifies the ingredients.\n* &quot;Recipefy&quot; a Dish: See a meal you like online or in a restaurant? Snap a photo, and the app generates a recipe to help you recreate it.\n* Generate from Prompt: Just describe what you&#x27;re in the mood for (e.g., &quot;a spicy, gluten-free pasta dish&quot;), and it will create a recipe from scratch.\n* Import from URL: Paste a link from a recipe website to import it into your cookbook.<p>You can also save all these recipes, create shopping lists, and set detailed preferences for diet, allergies, cuisine, and even the cookware you own.\nApp is in a freemium model, within limits you can really test out core features without any payment or even account creation.<p>The Tech Stack: For those interested, the app is built with:\n* Frontend: React Native (with Expo)\n* Backend: Firebase Functions for the API layer.\n* Database &amp; Storage: Firestore and Firebase Cloud Storage.\n* AI: Google&#x27;s Gemini API for recipe generation and analysis.\n* Image Generation: DeepInfra API (for Stable Diffusion).\n* Subscriptions: RevenueCat.<p>I&#x27;ve just launched on the App Store and would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, thoughts, or questions you might have.<p>You can check it out here: \n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chefiniti.app\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chefiniti.app</a>\nOr download directly\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;chefiniti-smart-recipe-creator&#x2F;id6745801080\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;chefiniti-smart-recipe-creator...</a>\nThanks for taking a look!",

This opens the door to some optimizations such as leveraging `flash-attention` on Metal (MPS Torch backend).\r\n<img width=\"2050\" height=\"752\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23ebfb20-7626-46a5-b264-76ffb8b8c811\" />\r\n\r\nThis is but the tip of the iceberg: with the work on kernels that we're heavily pushing forward, expect speed-ups on several backends in the coming months!!\r\n\r\nThis release also includes the first steps to enabling efficient distributed training natively in transformers. Loading a 100B model takes ~3 seconds on our cluster — we hope this will be the norm for everyone! We are working on distributed checkpointing as well, and want to make sure our API can be easily used for any type of parallelism.\r\n\r\nWe want the community to benefit from all of the advances, and as always, include all hardware and platforms! We believe the kernels library will give the tools to optimize everything, making a big difference for the industry!\r\n\r\n## New models\r\n\r\n### Ernie 4.5\r\n\r\nThe Ernie 4.5 model was released in the [Ernie 4.5 Model Family](https://ernie.baidu.com/blog/posts/ernie4.5/) release by baidu.\r\nThis family of models contains multiple different architectures and model sizes. This model in specific targets the base text\r\nmodel without mixture of experts (moe) with 0.3B parameters in total. It uses the standard [Llama](./llama.md) at its core.\r\n\r\nOther models from the family can be found at [Ernie 4.5 MoE](./ernie4_5_moe.md).\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex justify-center\">\r\n    <img src=\"https://ernie.baidu.com/blog/posts/ernie4.5/overview.png\"/>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n* [`Ernie 4.5`] Add ernie text models  by @vasqu in #39228\r\n\r\n### Voxtral\r\n\r\nVoxtral is an upgrade of [Ministral 3B and Mistral Small 3B](https://mistral.ai/news/ministraux), extending its language capabilities with audio input support. It is designed to handle tasks such as speech transcription, translation, and audio understanding.\r\n\r\nYou can read more in Mistral's [realease blog post](https://mistral.ai/news/voxtral).\r\n\r\nThe model is available in two checkpoints:\r\n- 3B: [mistralai/Voxtral-Mini-3B-2507](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Voxtral-Mini-3B-2507)\r\n- 24B: [mistralai/Voxtral-Small-24B-2507](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Voxtral-Small-24B-2507)\r\n\r\n#### Key Features\r\n\r\nVoxtral builds on Ministral-3B by adding audio processing capabilities:\r\n\r\n- **Transcription mode**: Includes a dedicated mode for speech transcription. By default, Voxtral detects the spoken language and transcribes it accordingly.  \r\n- **Long-form context**: With a 32k token context window, Voxtral can process up to 30 minutes of audio for transcription or 40 minutes for broader audio understanding.  \r\n- **Integrated Q&A and summarization**: Supports querying audio directly and producing structured summaries without relying on separate ASR and language models.  \r\n- **Multilingual support**: Automatically detects language and performs well across several widely spoken languages, including English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Hindi, German, Dutch, and Italian.  \r\n- **Function calling via voice**: Can trigger functions or workflows directly from spoken input based on detected user intent.  \r\n- **Text capabilities**: Maintains the strong text processing performance of its Ministral-3B foundation.\r\n\r\n* Add voxtral  by @eustlb in #39429\r\n\r\n### LFM2\r\n\r\n[LFM2](https://www.liquid.ai/blog/liquid-foundation-models-v2-our-second-series-of-generative-ai-models) represents a new generation of Liquid Foundation Models developed by [Liquid AI](https://liquid.ai/), specifically designed for edge AI and on-device deployment. \r\n\r\nThe models are available in three sizes (350M, 700M, and 1.2B parameters) and are engineered to run efficiently on CPU, GPU, and NPU hardware, making them particularly well-suited for applications requiring low latency, offline operation, and privacy.\r\n\r\n* LFM2  by @paulpak58 in #39340\r\n\r\n### DeepSeek v2\r\n\r\nThe DeepSeek-V2 model was proposed in [DeepSeek-V2: A Strong, Economical, and Efficient Mixture-of-Experts Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04434) by DeepSeek-AI Team.\r\n\r\nThe model uses Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and DeepSeekMoE architectures for efficient inference and cost-effective training. It employs an auxiliary-loss-free strategy for load balancing and multi-token prediction training objective. The model can be used for various language tasks after being pre-trained on 14.8 trillion tokens and going through Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning stages.\r\n\r\n* Add DeepSeek V2 Model into Transformers  by @VladOS95-cyber in #36400\r\n\r\n### ModernBERT Decoder models\r\n\r\nModernBERT Decoder is the same architecture as [ModernBERT](https://huggingface.co/papers/2412.13663) but trained from scratch with a causal language modeling (CLM) objective. This allows for using the same architecture for comparing encoders and decoders. This is the decoder architecture implementation of ModernBERT, designed for autoregressive text generation tasks.\r\n\r\nLike the encoder version, ModernBERT Decoder incorporates modern architectural improvements such as rotary positional embeddings to support sequences of up to 8192 tokens, unpadding to avoid wasting compute on padding tokens, GeGLU layers, and alternating attention patterns. However, it uses causal (unidirectional) attention to enable autoregressive generation.\r\n\r\n* Add ModernBERT Decoder Models - ModernBERT, but trained with CLM!  by @orionw in #38967\r\n\r\n### EoMT\r\n\r\nThe Encoder-only Mask Transformer (EoMT) model was introduced in the CVPR 2025 Highlight Paper [Your ViT is Secretly an Image Segmentation Model](https://www.tue-mps.org/eomt) by Tommie Kerssies, Niccolò Cavagnero, Alexander Hermans, Narges Norouzi, Giuseppe Averta, Bastian Leibe, Gijs Dubbelman, and Daan de Geus.\r\nEoMT reveals Vision Transformers can perform image segmentation efficiently without task-specific components.\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/transformers/model_doc/eomt_architecture.png\"\r\n       alt=\"drawing\" width=\"500\"/>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n* ✨ Add EoMT Model ||  🚨 Fix Mask2Former loss calculation  by @yaswanth19 in #37610\r\n\r\n### Doge\r\n\r\nDoge is a series of small language models based on the [Doge](https://github.com/SmallDoges/small-doge) architecture, aiming to combine the advantages of state-space and self-attention algorithms, calculate dynamic masks from cached value states using the zero-order hold method, and solve the problem of existing mainstream language models getting lost in context. It uses the `wsd_scheduler` scheduler to pre-train on the `smollm-corpus`, and can continue training on new datasets or add sparse activation feedforward networks from stable stage checkpoints.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/refs%2Fpr%2F426/transformers/model_doc/doge_architecture.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"600\"\r\n\r\n* Add Doge model  by @LoserCheems in #35891\r\n\r\n### AIM v2\r\n\r\nThe AIMv2 model was proposed in [Multimodal Autoregressive Pre-training of Large Vision Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14402) by Enrico Fini, Mustafa Shukor, Xiujun Li, Philipp Dufter, Michal Klein, David Haldimann, Sai Aitharaju, Victor Guilherme Turrisi da Costa, Louis Béthune, Zhe Gan, Alexander T Toshev, Marcin Eichner, Moin Nabi, Yinfei Yang, Joshua M. Susskind, Alaaeldin El-Nouby.\r\n\r\nThe abstract from the paper is the following:\r\n\r\n*We introduce a novel method for pre-training of large-scale vision encoders. Building on recent advancements in autoregressive pre-training of vision models, we extend this framework to a multimodal setting, i.e., images and text. In this paper, we present AIMV2, a family of generalist vision encoders characterized by a straightforward pre-training process, scalability, and remarkable performance across a range of downstream tasks. This is achieved by pairing the vision encoder with a multimodal decoder that autoregressively generates raw image patches and text tokens. Our encoders excel not only in multimodal evaluations but also in vision benchmarks such as localization, grounding, and classification. Notably, our AIMV2-3B encoder achieves 89.5% accuracy on ImageNet-1k with a frozen trunk. Furthermore, AIMV2 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art contrastive models (e.g., CLIP, SigLIP) in multimodal image understanding across diverse settings.*\r\n\r\n* Add Aimv2 model  by @yaswanth19 in #36625\r\n\r\n### PerceptionLM\r\n\r\nThe PerceptionLM model was proposed in [PerceptionLM: Open-Access Data and Models for Detailed Visual Understanding](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/perceptionlm-open-access-data-and-models-for-detailed-visual-understanding/) by Jang Hyun Cho et al. It's a fully open, reproducible model for transparent research in image and video understanding. PLM consists of\r\na vision encoder with a small scale (<8B parameters) LLM decoder.\r\n\r\n* PerceptionLM  by @shuminghu in #37878\r\n\r\n### Efficient LoFTR\r\n\r\nThe EfficientLoFTR model was proposed in [Efficient LoFTR: Semi-Dense Local Feature Matching with Sparse-Like Speed](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04765) by Yifan Wang, Xingyi He, Sida Peng, Dongli Tan and Xiaowei Zhou.\r\n\r\nThis model consists of matching two images together by finding pixel correspondences. It can be used to estimate the pose between them. \r\nThis model is useful for tasks such as image matching, homography estimation, etc.\r\n\r\n* Add EfficientLoFTR model  by @sbucaille in #36355\r\n\r\n### EVOLLA\r\n\r\n<img width=\"2772\" height=\"3276\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fb76e17-9bff-4edc-9ac8-205f4b58a898\" />\r\n\r\nEvolla is an advanced 80-billion-parameter protein-language generative model designed to decode the molecular language of proteins. It integrates information from protein sequences, structures, and user queries to generate precise and contextually nuanced insights into protein function. Trained on an unprecedented AI-generated dataset of 546 million protein question-answer pairs and 150 billion word tokens, Evolla significantly advances research in proteomics and functional genomics, providing expert-level insights and shedding light on the molecular logic encoded in proteins.\r\n\r\n* Add evolla rebase main  by @zhoubay in #36232\r\n\r\n### DeepSeek VL\r\n\r\n<img width=\"824\" height=\"1017\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/298074a0-c509-4e0b-9adb-c72bac206b18\" />\r\n\r\n[Deepseek-VL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05525) was introduced by the DeepSeek AI team. It is a vision-language model (VLM) designed to process both text and images for generating contextually relevant responses. The model leverages [LLaMA](./llama) as its text encoder, while [SigLip](./siglip) is used for encoding images.\r\n\r\n* Add support for DeepseekAI's DeepseekVL  by @geetu040 in #36248\r\n\r\n### xLSTM\r\n\r\n<img width=\"692\" height=\"434\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/164243ba-1fd8-48b5-b565-3396d640ce0e\" />\r\n\r\nThe xLSTM model was proposed in [xLSTM: Extended Long Short-Term Memory](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ARAxPPIAhq) by Maximilian Beck*, Korbinian Pöppel*, Markus Spanring, Andreas Auer, Oleksandra Prudnikova, Michael Kopp, Günter Klambauer, Johannes Brandstetter and Sepp Hochreiter.\r\nxLSTM updates the original LSTM architecture to be competitive with Transformer models by introducing exponential gating, matrix memory expansion, and parallelizable training and ingestion.\r\n\r\nThe [7B model](https://hf.co/NX-AI/xLSTM-7b) variant was trained by the xLSTM team Maximilian Beck, Korbinian Pöppel, Phillip Lippe, Richard Kurle, Patrick Blies, Sebastian Böck and Sepp Hochreiter at NXAI.\r\n\r\n* Add xlstm model  by @Cyrilvallez in #39665\r\n\r\n### EXAONE 4.0\r\n\r\n<img width=\"3750\" height=\"954\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/591040d2-d90a-4770-a4a7-0d91e21263fb\" />\r\n\r\n**[EXAONE 4.0](https://github.com/LG-AI-EXAONE/EXAONE-4.0)** model is the language model, which integrates a **Non-reasoning mode** and **Reasoning mode** to achieve both the excellent usability of [EXAONE 3.5](https://github.com/LG-AI-EXAONE/EXAONE-3.5) and the advanced reasoning abilities of [EXAONE Deep](https://github.com/LG-AI-EXAONE/EXAONE-Deep). To pave the way for the agentic AI era, EXAONE 4.0 incorporates essential features such as agentic tool use, and its multilingual capabilities are extended to support Spanish in addition to English and Korean. \r\n\r\nThe EXAONE 4.0 model series consists of two sizes: a mid-size **32B** model optimized for high performance, and a small-size **1.2B** model designed for on-device applications.\r\n\r\n* Add EXAONE 4.0 model  by @lgai-exaone in #39129\r\n\r\n## Parallelisation\r\nWe've added Expert Parallel support for Llama4, next release will include it for all model! You can just set a `distributed_config` with `enable_expert_parallel=True`. This is enabling efficient training of sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models across multiple devices. This allows each expert in the MoE layer to run in parallel (instead of previous TP which requires more communication), significantly improving scalability and memory efficiency. \r\n\r\n* Add ep  by @ArthurZucker in #39501\r\n\r\n## Quantization\r\n\r\n### FP Quant\r\nFP-Quant is a quantization method optimized for Blackwell-generation Nvidia GPUs, supporting efficient post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT) of LLMs using MXFP4 and NVFP4 formats.\r\n\r\nCurrently, only PTQ with MXFP4 is available. You can quantize models on-the-fly using transformers:\r\n```\r\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, FPQuantConfig\r\n\r\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\r\n    \"qwen/Qwen3-8B\",\r\n    quantization_config=FPQuantConfig(),\r\n    device_map=\"cuda\",\r\n    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,\r\n)\r\n```\r\nFP-Quant requires a Blackwell GPU and runs via the QuTLASS library. No Blackwell GPU? Use `FPQuantConfig(pseudoquant=True)` to emulate quantization (no QuTLASS needed).\r\n\r\nThe following results show the inference speedup of QuTLASS MXFP4 over PyTorch BF16 in Transformers. MXFP4 gives consistent speedups across all batch sizes, reaching up to 4× faster at larger scales.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/transformers/model_doc/qwen3-8b-end-to-end-prefill-speedup-mxfp4-vs-bf16-on-rtx5090.svg\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"600\">\r\n\r\n* FP-Quant support by @BlackSamorez in #38696 \r\n\r\n## Kernels\r\n\r\nThe **kernels** project aims to become the single trusted source for high-performance kernels in the Transformers ecosystem. We're working toward centralizing all kernels on the **Hub**, so updates, bug fixes, and improvements can happen in one place—no more scattered repos and no compilation headaches!\r\n\r\nYou can already try it out today by setting `use_kernels=True` in `from_pretrained`. Any contributor can build their kernel, register it and use it right away—no extra setup, more on this [here](https://github.com/huggingface/kernel-builder/blob/main/docs/writing-kernels.md)\r\n\r\nEven better: want to use **Flash Attention 3**? No need to deal with tricky compilation and missing symbols issues! Just drop in:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nmodel.set_attn_implementation(\"kernels-community/flash-attn3\")\r\n```\r\nThis automatically fetches the right build for your setup (e.g. CUDA and PyTorch versions).\r\n\r\nWe’re also teaming up with amazing kernel devs from Unsloth, Liger, vLLM, and more to bring their work directly to the Hub—making it easier than ever to access amazing performance with a single line of code.\r\n\r\n* Kernels flash attn  by @ArthurZucker in #39474\r\n\r\n## Transformers Serve\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9928f62b-543c-4b8a-b81b-4a6e262c229e\r\n\r\nOver the past few months, we have been putting more and more functionality in the `transformers chat` utility, which offers a CLI-based app to chat with chat models. We've chosen to push this further by splitting the backend of `transformers chat` in a new, separate utility called `transformers serve`.\r\n\r\nThis is ideal for experimentation purposes, or to run models locally for personal and private use. It does not aim to compete with dedicated inference engines such as vLLM or SGLang.\r\n\r\nModels of diverse modalities supported by transformers may be served with the transformers serve CLI. It spawns a local server that offers compatibility with the OpenAI SDK, which is the de-facto standard for LLM conversations and other related tasks. This way, you can use the server from many third party applications, or test it using the transformers chat CLI ([docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/conversations.md#chat-cli)).\r\n\r\nThe server supports the following REST APIs:\r\n\r\n- `/v1/chat/completions`\r\n- `/v1/responses`\r\n- `/v1/audio/transcriptions`\r\n- `/v1/models`\r\n\r\nRelevant commits:\r\n\r\n* Split `transformers chat` and `transformers serve`   by @LysandreJik in #38443\r\n* [serve] Cursor support, move docs into separate page, add more examples  by @gante in #39133\r\n* Fix continuous batching in `transformers serve`  by @LysandreJik in #39149\r\n* [server] add tests and fix passing a custom `generation_config`  by @gante in #39230\r\n* [serve] Model name or path should be required  by @LysandreJik in #39178\r\n* Random serve fixes  by @pcuenca in #39176\r\n* [tests] tag serve tests as slow   by @gante in #39343\r\n* Responses API in `transformers serve`  by @LysandreJik in #39155\r\n* [serve] Add speech to text (`/v1/audio/transcriptions`)  by @gante in #39434\r\n* Transformers serve VLM  by @LysandreJik in #39454\r\n\r\n## Refactors\r\n\r\nSignificant refactors have been underway in `transformers`, aiming to reduce the complexity of the code. A metric we follow to see how the refactors impact our code is to follow the number of lines in a given model; we try to reduce it as much as possible, while keeping everything related to the forward pass and model definition in that file.\r\n\r\nSee the evolution here:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1200\" height=\"600\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c232bc8d-7d7c-4192-baa8-a60efe5eb2ff\" />\r\n\r\nSome notable refactors:\r\n\r\n### KV caching\r\n\r\nKV caches are now defined per layer, enabling new hybrid caches that mix different attention types. `CacheProcessor`s also encapsulate cache quantization and offloading, making them easy to customize.\r\n\r\n* [cache refactor] Move all the caching logic to a per-layer approach by @manueldeprada in #39106\r\n\r\n### Handling specific attributes like `output_attentions` or `output_hidden_states`\r\n\r\nSuch attributes require very specific handling within the forward call, while they're not important to understand how the model works. We remove that code but keep the functionality by providing a better utility to handle it.\r\n\r\n* Refactor the way we handle outputs for new llamas and new models  by @ArthurZucker in #39120\r\n\r\n### Setting the attention implementation\r\n\r\nWe refactor the way to explicitly set the attention implementation so that it has a method dedicated to it.\r\n\r\n* [refactor] set
