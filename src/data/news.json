Pressing twice within 3 seconds now kills all background agents.\n- Fixed prompt suggestion cache regression that reduced cache hit rates.\n- Fixed `plugin enable` and `plugin disable` to auto-detect the correct scope when `--scope` is not specified, instead of always defaulting to user scope\n- Simple mode (`CLAUDE_CODE_SIMPLE`) now includes the file edit tool in addition to the Bash tool, allowing direct file editing in simple mode.\n- Permission suggestions are now populated when safety checks trigger an ask response, enabling SDK consumers to display permission options\n- Sonnet 4.5 with 1M context is being removed from the Max plan in favor of our frontier Sonnet 4.6 model, which now has 1M context. Please switch in /model.\n- Fixed verbose mode not updating thinking block display when toggled via `/config` — memo comparators now correctly detect verbose changes\n- Fixed unbounded WASM memory growth during long sessions by periodically resetting the tree-sitter parser\n- Fixed potential rendering issues caused by stale yoga layout references\n- Improved performance in non-interactive mode (`-p`) by skipping unnecessary API calls during startup\n- Improved performance by caching authentication failures for HTTP and SSE MCP servers, avoiding repeated connection attempts to servers requiring auth\n- Fixed unbounded memory growth during long-running sessions caused by Yoga WASM linear memory never shrinking\n- SDK model info now includes `supportsEffort`, `supportedEffortLevels`, and `supportsAdaptiveThinking` fields so consumers can discover model capabilities.\n- Added `ConfigChange` hook event that fires when configuration files change during a session, enabling enterprise security auditing and optional blocking of settings changes.\n- Improved startup performance by caching MCP auth failures to avoid redundant connection attempts\n- Improved startup performance by reducing HTTP calls for analytics token counting\n- Improved startup performance by batching MCP tool token counting into a single API call\n- Fixed `disableAllHooks` setting to respect managed settings hierarchy — non-managed settings can no longer disable managed hooks set by policy (#26637)\n- Fixed `--resume` session picker showing raw XML tags for sessions that start with commands like `/clear`. Now correctly falls through to the session ID fallback.\n- Improved permission prompts for path safety and working directory blocks to show the reason for the restriction instead of a bare prompt with no context\n",

Background agents now continue running when you press ESC to cancel the main thread, giving you more control over agent lifecycle.\n- Fixed API 400 errors (\"thinking blocks cannot be modified\") that occurred in sessions with concurrent agents, caused by interleaved streaming content blocks preventing proper message merging.\n- Simplified teammate navigation to use only Shift+Down (with wrapping) instead of both Shift+Up and Shift+Down.\n- Fixed an issue where a single file write/edit error would abort all other parallel file write/edit operations. Independent file mutations now complete even when a sibling fails.\n- Added `last_assistant_message` field to Stop and SubagentStop hook inputs, providing the final assistant response text so hooks can access it without parsing transcript files.\n- Fixed custom session titles set via `/rename` being lost after resuming a conversation (anthropics/claude-code#23610)\n- Fixed collapsed read/search hint text overflowing on narrow terminals by truncating from the start.\n- Fixed an issue where bash commands with backslash-newline continuation lines (e.g., long commands split across multiple lines with `\\`) would produce spurious empty arguments, potentially breaking command execution.\n- Fixed built-in slash commands (`/help`, `/model`, `/compact`, etc.) being hidden from the autocomplete dropdown when many user skills are installed (anthropics/claude-code#22020)\n- Fixed MCP servers not appearing in the MCP Management Dialog after deferred loading\n- Fixed session name persisting in status bar after `/clear` command (anthropics/claude-code#26082)\n- Fixed crash when a skill's `name` or `description` in SKILL.md frontmatter is a bare number (e.g., `name: 3000`) — the value is now properly coerced to a string (anthropics/claude-code#25837)\n- Fixed /resume silently dropping sessions when the first message exceeds 16KB or uses array-format content (anthropics/claude-code#25721)\n- Added `chat:newline` keybinding action for configurable multi-line input (anthropics/claude-code#26075)\n- Added `added_dirs` to the statusline JSON `workspace` section, exposing directories added via `/add-dir` to external scripts (anthropics/claude-code#26096)\n- Fixed `claude doctor` misclassifying mise and asdf-managed installations as native installs

results returning raw transcript data instead of the agent's final answer (anthropics/claude-code#26012)\n- Fixed Warp terminal incorrectly prompting for Shift+Enter setup when it supports it natively (anthropics/claude-code#25957)\n- Fixed CJK wide characters causing misaligned timestamps and layout elements in the TUI (anthropics/claude-code#26084)\n- Fixed custom agent `model` field in `.claude/agents/*.md` being ignored when spawning team teammates (anthropics/claude-code#26064)\n- Fixed plan mode being lost after context compaction, causing the model to switch from planning to implementation mode (anthropics/claude-code#26061)\n- Fixed `alwaysThinkingEnabled: true` in settings.json not enabling thinking mode on Bedrock and Vertex providers (anthropics/claude-code#26074)\n- Fixed `tool_decision` OTel telemetry event not being emitted in headless/SDK mode (anthropics/claude-code#26059)\n- Fixed session name being lost after context compaction — renamed sessions now preserve their custom title through compaction (anthropics/claude-code#26121)\n- Increased initial session count in resume picker from 10 to 50 for faster session discovery (anthropics/claude-code#26123)\n- Windows: fixed worktree session matching when drive letter casing differs (anthropics/claude-code#26123)\n- Fixed `/resume <session-id>` failing to find sessions whose first message exceeds 16KB (anthropics/claude-code#25920)\n- Fixed \"Always allow\" on multiline bash commands creating invalid permission patterns that corrupt settings (anthropics/claude-code#25909)\n- Fixed React crash (error #31) when a skill's `argument-hint` in SKILL.md frontmatter uses YAML sequence syntax (e.g., `[topic: foo | bar]`) — the value is now properly coerced to a string (anthropics/claude-code#25826)\n- Fixed crash when using `/fork` on sessions that used web search — null entries in search results from transcript deserialization are now handled gracefully (anthropics/claude-code#25811)\n- Fixed read-only git commands triggering FSEvents file watcher loops on macOS by adding --no-optional-locks flag (anthropics/claude-code#25750)\n-

(anthropics/claude-code#25816)\n- Fixed non-interactive subcommands like `claude doctor` and `claude plugin validate` being blocked inside nested Claude sessions (anthropics/claude-code#25803)\n- Windows: Fixed the same CLAUDE.md file being loaded twice when drive letter casing differs between paths (anthropics/claude-code#25756)\n- Fixed inline code spans in markdown being incorrectly parsed as bash commands (anthropics/claude-code#25792)\n- Fixed teammate spinners not respecting custom spinnerVerbs from settings (anthropics/claude-code#25748)\n- Fixed shell commands permanently failing after a command deletes its own working directory (anthropics/claude-code#26136)\n- Fixed hooks (PreToolUse, PostToolUse) silently failing to execute on Windows by using Git Bash instead of cmd.exe (anthropics/claude-code#25981)\n- Fixed LSP `findReferences` and other location-based operations returning results from gitignored files (e.g., `node_modules/`, `venv/`)

Unlike the offline [Voxtral](./voxtral) model which processes complete audio files, VoxtralRealtime is architected for low-latency, incremental transcription by processing audio in chunks as they arrive.\r\n\r\nThe model combines an audio encoder with a Mistral-based language model decoder, using time conditioning embeddings and causal convolutions with padding caches to enable efficient streaming inference.\r\n\r\n* Add Voxtral Realtime (#43769) by @eustlb\r\n\r\n### GLM-5 - GlmMoeDsa\r\n\r\n<img width=\"947\" height=\"638\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c4fff37-7f40-4e86-b4a0-db718f45c93b\" />\r\n\r\nThe zAI team launches GLM-5, and introduces it as such:\r\n\r\n> GLM-5, targeting complex systems engineering and long-horizon agentic tasks. Scaling is still one of the most important ways to improve the intelligence efficiency of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Compared to GLM-4.5, GLM-5 scales from 355B parameters (32B active) to 744B parameters (40B active), and increases pre-training data from 23T to 28.5T tokens. GLM-5 also integrates DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA), largely reducing deployment cost while preserving long-context capacity.\r\n> \r\n> Reinforcement learning aims to bridge the gap between competence and excellence in pre-trained models. However, deploying it at scale for LLMs is a challenge due to the RL training inefficiency. To this end, we developed [slime](https://github.com/THUDM/slime), a novel asynchronous RL infrastructure that substantially improves training throughput and efficiency, enabling more fine-grained post-training iterations. With advances in both pre-training and post-training, GLM-5 delivers significant improvement compared to GLM-4.7 across a wide range of academic benchmarks and achieves best-in-class performance among all open-source models in the world on reasoning, coding, and agentic tasks, closing the gap with frontier models.\r\n\r\n* Add GlmMoeDsa (#43858) by @Cyrilvallez\r\n\r\n### Qwen3.5, Qwen3.5 Moe\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b56dcaca-80e7-4b22-80a5-2f767bb65095\" />\r\n\r\nThe Qwen team launches Qwen 3.5, and introduces it as such:\r\n\r\n> We are delighted to announce the official release of Qwen3.5, introducing the open-weight of the first model in the Qwen3.5 series, namely Qwen3.5-397B-A17B. As a native vision-language model, Qwen3.5-397B-A17B demonstrates outstanding results across a full range of benchmark evaluations, including reasoning, coding, agent capabilities, and multimodal understanding, empowering developers and enterprises to achieve significantly greater productivity. Built on an innovative hybrid architecture that fuses linear attention (via Gated Delta Networks) with a sparse mixture-of-experts, the model attains remarkable inference efficiency: although it comprises 397 billion total parameters, just 17 billion are activated per forward pass, optimizing both speed and cost without sacrificing capability. We have also expanded our language and dialect support from 119 to 201, providing broader accessibility and enhanced support to users around the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Adding Support for Qwen3.5 (#43830) by @bozheng-hit\r\n\r\n### VibeVoice Acoustic Tokenizer\r\n\r\n<img width=\"821\" height=\"349\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1433597-b43b-4d2d-a2c7-216d7792b8c9\" />\r\n\r\n[VibeVoice](https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.19205) is a novel framework for synthesizing high-fidelity, long-form speech with multiple speakers by employing a next-token diffusion approach within a Large Language Model (LLM) structure. It's designed to capture the authentic conversational \"vibe\" and is particularly suited for generating audio content like podcasts and multi-participant audiobooks.\r\n\r\nOne key feature of VibeVoice is the use of two continuous audio tokenizers, one for extracting acoustic features and another for semantic features.\r\n\r\n* Add VibeVoice Acoustic Tokenizer (#43400) by @ebezzam\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n\r\n* :rotating_light: [`Attn`] New attn mask interface everywhere (#42848)\r\n* :rotating_light: Modify ModernBERT's default attention implementation to stop using FA (#43764)\r\n\r\n:rotating_light: This one is quite breaking for super super super old modles: :rotating_light: :rotating_light: \r\n* fix: Prevent AutoTokenizer type mismatch from directory name substrin… (#43791) \r\nIf the config does not have a model-type field, we no longer check the name of the folder like for https://huggingface.co/prajjwal1/bert-tiny/blob/main/config.json\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes and improvements\r\n\r\n* [docs] deploying (#43241) by @stevhliu\r\n* [Trainer] Move NEFTune impl to standalone functions (#43714) by @SunMarc\r\n* Fix `convert_rope_params_to_dict` so it uses `rope_theta` from the config (#43766) by @hmellor\r\n* Bump dev version (#43777) by @qgallouedec\r\n* Improved `AGENTS.md` (#43763) by @tarekziade\r\n* Fix-release-ubild (#43773) by @ArthurZucker\r\n* unpin torch for CircleCI (#43790) by @ydshieh\r\n* [`Modular Dependencies`] Fixup qwen rms norms (#43772) by @vasqu\r\n* fix(testing): Fix BLOOM tokenizer, CLAP audio features, and CLVP text tester usage in tests (#43798) by @harshaljanjani\r\n* Remove unconditional train_batch_size assignment (#43770) by @lordaarush\r\n* [`Repo Consistency`] Fix rms norm (#43803) by @vasqu\r\n* fix: Prevent AutoTokenizer type mismatch from directory name substrin… (#43791) by @tarekziade\r\n* Refactor trainer data_collator and callbacks tests (#43776) by @SunMarc\r\n* [core] Faster and thread-safe `check_model_inputs` implementation (#43765) by @Cyrilvallez\r\n* [Trainer] use deepspeed SP process group when Accelerate doesn’t build a mesh (#43799) by @kashif\r\n* fix(flaky): enforce manual seed to reduce flakiness (#43794) by @tarekziade\r\n* Add TRL CI bot workflow to trigger tests on PR comments (#43809) by @qgallouedec\r\n* Fix DeepSpeed model preparation logic in Trainer class (#43780) by @qgallouedec\r\n* [docs] reveal more in toctree (#43808) by @stevhliu\r\n* Fix markdown documentation (#43076) by @cyyever\r\n* Fix slack-report workflow file (#43851) by @ydshieh\r\n* add `do_sample=False` to qwen2_5_vl model tests to stablize the output (#43728) by @kaixuanliu\r\n* Fix incorrect timestamp calculation in Qwen3VL Processor (#43659) by @jonathan-fulton\r\n* Remove GPU tracking from TrackioCallback and remove env var support (#43371) by @qgallouedec\r\n* Add id and resume support to SwanLab integration (#43719) by @i-pj\r\n* fix gptoss crash in tp (#43853) by @sywangyi\r\n* Delete batch_split from EncoderDecoderCache (#43814) by @cyyever\r\n* delete unnecessary code to make moe compatible to full graph compile (#43855) by @kaixuanliu\r\n* Update ModelType for Unigram tokenizer (#43860) by @pavel-esir\r\n* [docs] Remove pipeline() examples from summarization/translation tasks (#43831) by @Mr-Neutr0n\r\n* Fix video interpolation in pe_audio_video (#43811) by @Rocketknight1\r\n* Look for the pad_token_id in the right place for Llama4 (#43539) by @Rocketknight1\r\n* Fix cardinality error for DETR models without explicit background class (#43513) by @heathdutton\r\n* docs: Add Switch Transformers docstring notes and update spectrogram comment (#43336) by @harshaljanjani\r\n* [xLSTM] Fix bugs preventing small model training (#43209) by @Anri-Lombard\r\n* docs: correct typo 'neccessary' to 'necessary' (#43868) by @thecaptain789\r\n* Improve PR comment CI feedback  (#43852) by @ydshieh\r\n* Fix init weights in remote code (#43768) by @zucchini-nlp\r\n* Fix GlmMoeDsaConfig default mlp_layer_types in modular conversion (#43876) by @OiPunk\r\n* [MistralCommonBackend] fix loading proc (#43887) by @eustlb\r\n* [`Jamba`] Fallback to slow path and warn instead of error out (#43889) by @vasqu\r\n* Fix SwanLab callback to forward resume init args (#43848) by @OiPunk\r\n* Fix old tech stack in doc (#43879) by @cyyever\r\n* Update TrainingArguments (#43806) by @SunMarc\r\n* Remove unnecessary code or checks for PT 2.4+ (#43787) by @cyyever\r\n* Make it possible to evaluate when using sequence parallel in HF Trainer (#43517) by @jp1924\r\n* [Trainer] Move optimizer cls init to trainer_optimizer.py (#43738) by @SunMarc\r\n* fix the error of tests/quantization/fbgemm_fp8/test_fbgemm_fp8.py::Fb… (#43547) by @sywangyi\r\n* fix fbgemm fp8 multi-device load failure.
