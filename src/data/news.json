One of its best features is the ability to sync your usage across devices, giving you a complete picture over different time periods. It respects your privacy by only collecting aggregated usage data. No conversation or code details are ever touched.<p>There has been some controversy around tracking usage and whether it might lead to price hikes or limits, but honestly, Anthropic probably already knows this data. The app is more about helping you optimise your workflow, not exposing anything sensitive. It also includes a ranking system so you can get a sense of how others are using Claude Code and maybe learn from their patterns.<p>I built it with a solid backend architecture to be scalable and responsive, running on a small Kubernetes cluster. The goal is to help people like us understand and improve how we work with Claude Code, all wrapped up in a simple web and CLI interface.",

It didn&#x27;t stand a chance against the hardest challenges.<p>This was the first CTF I&#x27;ve participated in, and it was an absolute blast. I can imagine some people feeling that LLMs take the fun out of CTFs, but I think the &quot;centaur&quot; [2] aspect of human-LLM interactions is both powerful and effective, given the right infrastructure and UX.<p>Happy to answer any questions people have about the project!<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.anthropic.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;docs&#x2F;claude-code&#x2F;slash-commands#custom-slash-commands\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.anthropic.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;docs&#x2F;claude-code&#x2F;slash-command...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Advanced_chess\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Advanced_chess</a>",

      "content": "I built a collection of professional slash commands for Anthropic&#x27;s Claude Code that provide structured workflows for common software development tasks.<p><pre><code>  These commands are directly inspired by and adapted from Anthropic&#x27;s own claude-code-best-practices (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anthropic.com&#x2F;engineering&#x2F;claude-code-best-practices) documentation, translating their recommendations into executable workflows.\n\n  The suite includes commands for:\n  • Comprehensive code reviews with security and performance analysis\n  • End-to-end feature development with planning, implementation, and testing\n  • Architectural analysis and design pattern assessment\n • Security audits and vulnerability scanning\n  • GitHub issue resolution with root cause analysis\n  • Performance optimization and build improvements\n\n  Each command follows a systematic approach based on Anthropic&#x27;s\n  best practices, breaking complex tasks into manageable steps.\n  Instead of ad-hoc AI interactions, you get consistent, thorough\n   workflows that adapt to any codebase.\n\n  The commands work through Claude Code&#x27;s slash command system -\n  just type `&#x2F;project:code-review` or `&#x2F;project:create-feature\n  user-authentication` and Claude follows the predefined\n  workflow.\n\n  Installation is straightforward with an interactive script that\n   can install project-specific or globally. The commands are\n  fully customizable markdown files, so you can adapt them to\n  your team&#x27;s specific requirements.\n\n</code></pre>\nI hope others find it useful!",
