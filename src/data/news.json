      "content": "Hi HN,<p>Happy to share the project I&#x27;ve been vibe-coding on for past few months.\nThe Problem: Like many people, I often found myself staring at a fridge full of random ingredients (some about to expire) with no idea what to cook. I was tired of food waste and the repetitive cycle of making the same few meals. I wanted a way to creatively use what I already had.<p>The Solution: So, I decided to build Chefiniti. It&#x27;s an iOS app that acts as a personal AI chef. The core idea is to turn your available food into delicious, custom recipes. I know there are already tons of apps like it but this one is mine :)<p>Here&#x27;s what it can do:\n* Scan Ingredients: Take photos of your fridge or pantry, and the app&#x27;s vision model identifies the ingredients.\n* &quot;Recipefy&quot; a Dish: See a meal you like online or in a restaurant? Snap a photo, and the app generates a recipe to help you recreate it.\n* Generate from Prompt: Just describe what you&#x27;re in the mood for (e.g., &quot;a spicy, gluten-free pasta dish&quot;), and it will create a recipe from scratch.\n* Import from URL: Paste a link from a recipe website to import it into your cookbook.<p>You can also save all these recipes, create shopping lists, and set detailed preferences for diet, allergies, cuisine, and even the cookware you own.\nApp is in a freemium model, within limits you can really test out core features without any payment or even account creation.<p>The Tech Stack: For those interested, the app is built with:\n* Frontend: React Native (with Expo)\n* Backend: Firebase Functions for the API layer.\n* Database &amp; Storage: Firestore and Firebase Cloud Storage.\n* AI: Google&#x27;s Gemini API for recipe generation and analysis.\n* Image Generation: DeepInfra API (for Stable Diffusion).\n* Subscriptions: RevenueCat.<p>I&#x27;ve just launched on the App Store and would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, thoughts, or questions you might have.<p>You can check it out here: \n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chefiniti.app\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chefiniti.app</a>\nOr download directly\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;chefiniti-smart-recipe-creator&#x2F;id6745801080\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;chefiniti-smart-recipe-creator...</a>\nThanks for taking a look!",

      "content": "Hey HN! We&#x27;re Nithin and Nikhil, twin brothers building BrowserOS (YC S24). We&#x27;re an open-source, privacy-first alternative to the AI browsers from big labs.<p>The big differentiator: on BrowserOS you can use local LLMs or BYOK and run the agent entirely on the client side, so your company&#x2F;sensitive data stays on your machine!<p>Today we&#x27;re launching filesystem access... just like Claude Cowork, our browser agent can read files, write files, run shell commands! But honestly, we didn&#x27;t plan for this. It turns out the privacy decision we made 9 months ago accidentally positioned us for this moment.<p>The architectural bet we made 9 months ago: Unlike other AI browsers (ChatGPT Atlas, Perplexity Comet) where the agent loop runs server-side, we decided early on to run our agent entirely on your machine (client side).<p>But building everything on the client side wasn&#x27;t smooth. We initially built our agent loop inside a Chrome extension. But we kept hitting walls -- service worker being single thread JS; not having access to NodeJS libraries. So we made the hard decision 2 months ago to throw away everything and start from scratch.<p>In the new architecture, our agent loop sits in a standalone binary that we ship alongside our Chromium. And we use gemini-cli for the agent loop with some tweaks! We wrote a neat adapter to translate between Gemini format and Vercel AI SDK format. You can look at our entire codebase here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.new&#x2F;browseros-agent\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.new&#x2F;browseros-agent</a><p>How we give browser access to filesystem: When Claude Cowork launched, we realized something: because Atlas and Comet run their agent loop server-side, there&#x27;s no good way for their agent to access your files without uploading them to the server first. But our agent was already local. Adding filesystem access meant just... opening the door (with your permissions ofc). Our agent can now read and write files just like Claude Code.<p>What you can actually do today:<p>a) Organize files in my desktop folder <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;NOZ7xjto6Uc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;NOZ7xjto6Uc</a><p>b) Open top 5 HN links, extract the details and write summary into a HTML file <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;uXvqs_TCmMQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;uXvqs_TCmMQ</a><p>--- Where we are now\nIf you haven&#x27;t tried us since the last Show HN (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=44523409\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=44523409</a>), give us another shot. The new architecture unlocked a ton of new features, and we&#x27;ve grown to 8.5K GitHub stars and 100K+ downloads:<p>c) You can now build more reliable workflows using n8n-like graph <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;H_bFfWIevSY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;H_bFfWIevSY</a><p>d) You can also use BrowserOS as an MCP server in Cursor or Claude Code <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;5nevh00lckM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;5nevh00lckM</a><p>We are very bullish on browser being the right platform for a Claude Cowork like agent. Browser is the most commonly used app by knowledge workers (emails, docs, spreadsheets, research, etc). And even Anthropic recognizes this -- for Claude Cowork, they have janky integration with browser via a chrome extension. But owning the entire stack allows us to build differentiated features that wouldn&#x27;t be possible otherwise. Ex:  Browser ACLs.<p>Agents can do dumb or destructive things, so we&#x27;re adding browser-level guardrails (think IAM for agents): &quot;role(agent): can never click buy&quot; or &quot;role(agent): read-only access on my bank&#x27;s homepage.&quot;<p>Curious to hear your take on this and the overall thesis.<p>We’ll be in the comments. Thanks for reading!<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;browseros-ai&#x2F;BrowserOS\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;browseros-ai&#x2F;BrowserOS</a><p>Download: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;browseros.com\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;browseros.com</a> (available for Mac, Windows, Linux!)",

But I didn&#x27;t build Solveig with a single kind of use case in mind.<p>---<p>So it&#x27;s yet another LLM-in-my-terminal?<p>Sort of. Solveig tries to do a few things that other tools don&#x27;t, and to do the shared features with clearer UX, explicit consent, and deeper configuration. It&#x27;s not an IDE extension, doesn&#x27;t require a GUI, and it&#x27;s not built for a specific user type or scenario.<p>At the same time, Solveig&#x27;s competitors are mature projects with real user testing that you should check out. I&#x27;ve written a detailed comparison (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FSilveiraa&#x2F;solveig&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;docs&#x2F;comparison.md\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FSilveiraa&#x2F;solveig&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;docs&#x2F;compari...</a>) to similar tools in the market in the docs.<p>---<p>UPCOMING<p>I have a Roadmap (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FSilveiraa&#x2F;solveig&#x2F;discussions&#x2F;2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FSilveiraa&#x2F;solveig&#x2F;discussions&#x2F;2</a>) available, and feel free to suggest new features or improvements. I&#x27;ve recently added user-defined system prompt templates, and now I&#x27;m working on adding token counting from API messages instead of relying on encoders.<p>---<p>A cool aspect of this project is that I can use Solveig to analyze and improve its own code itself, which also gives me a lot of exposure to its actual usability.<p>I appreciate any feedback or comment, especially anyone who can try out Solveig using Anthropic or Gemini APIs. Tell me if it helped you do something or what stopped you from using it properly in your specific case. Even if you can&#x27;t see how Solveig could help you let me know, that&#x27;s an issue with me communicating value that I need to fix.<p>Leaving a star on the repository (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FSilveiraa&#x2F;solveig\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FSilveiraa&#x2F;solveig</a>) is also very much appreciated.",

      "content": "I finally got around to making a tool I&#x27;ve wanted for a long time: you can basically think of it as being &quot;like Gmail for coding agents.&quot;<p>If you&#x27;ve ever tried to use a bunch of instances of Claude Code or Codex at once across the same project, you&#x27;ve probably noticed how annoying it can be when they freak out about the other agent changing the files they&#x27;re working on.<p>Then they start doing annoying things, like restoring files from git, in the process wiping out another agent&#x27;s work without a backup.<p>Or if you&#x27;ve tried to have agents coordinate on two separate repos, like a Python backend and a Nextjs frontend for the same project, you may have found yourself acting as the go-between and liaison between two or three different agents, passing messages between them or having them communicate by means of markdown files or some other workaround.<p>I always knew there had to be a better way. But it&#x27;s hard to get the big providers to offer something like that in a way that&#x27;s universal, because Anthropic doesn&#x27;t want to integrate with OpenAI&#x27;s competitive coding tool, and neither wants to deal with Cursor or Gemini-CLI.<p>So a few days ago, I started working on it, and it&#x27;s now ready to share with the world. Introducing the 100% open-source MCP Agent Mail tool. This can be set up very quickly and easily on your machine and automatically detects all the most common coding agents and configures everything for you.<p>I also include a ready-made blurb (see the README file in the repo) that you can add to your existing AGENTS dot md or CLAUDE dot md file to help the agents better leverage the system straight out of the gate.<p>It&#x27;s almost comical how quickly the agents take to this system like a fish to water. They seem to relish in it, sending very detailed messages to each other just like humans do, and start coordinating in a natural, powerful way. They even give each other good ideas and pushback on bad ideas.<p>They can also reserve access to certain files to avoid the &quot;too many cooks&quot; problems associated with having too many agents all working on the same project at the same time, all without dealing with git worktrees and &quot;merge hell.&quot;<p>This also introduces a natural and powerful way to do something I&#x27;ve also long wanted, which is to automatically have multiple different frontier models working together in a collaborative, complementary way without me needing to be in the middle coordinating everything like a parent setting up playdates for their kids.<p>And for the human in the loop, I made a really slick web frontend that you can view and see all the messages your agents are sending each other in a nice, Gmail-like interface, so you can monitor the process. You can even send a special message to some or all your agents as the &quot;Human Overseer&quot; to give them a directive (of course, you can also just type that in manually into each coding agent, too.)<p>I made this for myself and know that I&#x27;m going to be getting a ton of usage out of it going forward. It really lets you unleash a massive number of agents using a bunch of different tools&#x2F;models, and they just naturally coordinate and work with each other without stepping on each other&#x27;s toes. It lets you as the human overseer relax a bit more as you no longer have to be the one responsible for coordinating things, and also because the agents watch each other and push back when they see mistakes and errors happening. Obviously, the greater the variety of models and agent tools you use, the more valuable that emergent peer review process will be.<p>Anyway, give it a try and let me know what you think. I&#x27;m sure there are a bunch of bugs that I&#x27;ll have to iron out over the next couple days, but I&#x27;ve already been productively using it today to work on another project and it is pretty amazingly functional already!",

No data upload required. It blends natural language and code in a single workflow, keeping variables in memory and letting you switch seamlessly between typing code and asking in plain English.<p>What it does:\n1. Chat with your data: Directly process CSV, Excel, AnnData, Pickle, Torch tensors, or any format supported by Python&#x2F;R&#x2F;Julia.\n2. Mixed programming: Variables persist across natural language and code; the CLI auto-generates and runs code for you.\n3. MCP-like agent integration: Read&#x2F;create files, run commands, fetch web pages, generate&#x2F;revise code.\n4. Human-like learning: Feed it a PDF paper or tutorial—Pantheon-CLI reads it, plans steps, and replicates methods before analysis.\n5. Task planning: Builds scientific agents by learning from papers&#x2F;tutorials (not just fixed, human-predefined steps).\n6. Multi-model support: Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, DeepSeek, Qwen, etc. + offline local LLMs (ollama, deepseek, gpt-oss).\n7. Multi-RAG support: Pre-learns from docs&#x2F;web into a local “brain” for more credible outputs without massive token costs.\n8. Built-in biology toolsets: For omics analysis (alignment, annotation, differential expression, full paper reproduction).\n9. Notebook mode: Brings the same agentic workflow into Jupyter—automatically runs and revises code, operates on files, and learns from tutorials&#x2F;papers.<p>Pantheon-CLI is our attempt to push beyond “AI writes code for you.” Instead, it’s an agentic operating system for data analysis, spanning both terminal and notebook.<p>Repo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aristoteleo&#x2F;pantheon-cli\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aristoteleo&#x2F;pantheon-cli</a><p>Tutorial: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pantheonos.stanford.edu&#x2F;cli&#x2F;docs&#x2F;intro&#x2F;getting-started\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pantheonos.stanford.edu&#x2F;cli&#x2F;docs&#x2F;intro&#x2F;getting-start...</a><p>Home page: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pantheonos.stanford.edu&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pantheonos.stanford.edu&#x2F;</a><p>Would love to hear feedback from the HN community—what use cases would you try this for, and what features would make it more useful to you?",

      "content": "I read about ingesting PDFs in Google Gemini here on HN last week [1]. This and some other thoughts that I had on AI [2] made me want to create a summarize PDF command line utility. Just point the utility to a PDF and get a summary back. However, I personally prefer to write CLI tools in Rust since those binaries are fast, small, and easy to distribute via `cargo install` (or `cargo binstall`). So that was a problem. I wanted to use a cloud provider since my system doesn&#x27;t have enough RAM for most state-of-the-art models, but at the same time, I didn&#x27;t want to require users of the tool to use the same API provider as me.<p>That&#x27;s why I created the `transformrs` Rust library [3]. The name is from &quot;transform&quot;, which is essentially what AI models do, and &quot;Rust&quot;. It is also a nod to the transformers algorithm.<p>To allow for proper testing in CI, I considered to make a mock endpoint that I could run my tests against. However, AI APIs are so cheap nowadays that I figured I could just as well run the tests against the actual endpoints. So that is what currently happens. Locally and in CI I have set up 5 different API keys and I run multiple tests against all of these endpoints, so that&#x27;s about 30 requests each time (tests run in 10 seconds). I change a file or each push to CI. It&#x27;s incredible how stable these endpoints have become. 18 tests check whether the prompt &quot;This is a test. Please respond with &#x27;hello world&#x27;&quot; actually responds with &quot;hello world&quot; and so far &gt;99% of the times it does. CI is way less flaky than I would have expected.<p>In any case, I hope people will find the library useful. I&#x27;m curious for feedback and suggestions.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=42952605\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=42952605</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huijzer.xyz&#x2F;posts&#x2F;ai-learning-rate&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huijzer.xyz&#x2F;posts&#x2F;ai-learning-rate&#x2F;</a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;transformrs&#x2F;transformrs\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;transformrs&#x2F;transformrs</a>",
