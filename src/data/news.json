      "content": "Hi HN,<p>Happy to share the project I&#x27;ve been vibe-coding on for past few months.\nThe Problem: Like many people, I often found myself staring at a fridge full of random ingredients (some about to expire) with no idea what to cook. I was tired of food waste and the repetitive cycle of making the same few meals. I wanted a way to creatively use what I already had.<p>The Solution: So, I decided to build Chefiniti. It&#x27;s an iOS app that acts as a personal AI chef. The core idea is to turn your available food into delicious, custom recipes. I know there are already tons of apps like it but this one is mine :)<p>Here&#x27;s what it can do:\n* Scan Ingredients: Take photos of your fridge or pantry, and the app&#x27;s vision model identifies the ingredients.\n* &quot;Recipefy&quot; a Dish: See a meal you like online or in a restaurant? Snap a photo, and the app generates a recipe to help you recreate it.\n* Generate from Prompt: Just describe what you&#x27;re in the mood for (e.g., &quot;a spicy, gluten-free pasta dish&quot;), and it will create a recipe from scratch.\n* Import from URL: Paste a link from a recipe website to import it into your cookbook.<p>You can also save all these recipes, create shopping lists, and set detailed preferences for diet, allergies, cuisine, and even the cookware you own.\nApp is in a freemium model, within limits you can really test out core features without any payment or even account creation.<p>The Tech Stack: For those interested, the app is built with:\n* Frontend: React Native (with Expo)\n* Backend: Firebase Functions for the API layer.\n* Database &amp; Storage: Firestore and Firebase Cloud Storage.\n* AI: Google&#x27;s Gemini API for recipe generation and analysis.\n* Image Generation: DeepInfra API (for Stable Diffusion).\n* Subscriptions: RevenueCat.<p>I&#x27;ve just launched on the App Store and would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, thoughts, or questions you might have.<p>You can check it out here: \n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chefiniti.app\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chefiniti.app</a>\nOr download directly\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;chefiniti-smart-recipe-creator&#x2F;id6745801080\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;chefiniti-smart-recipe-creator...</a>\nThanks for taking a look!",

Unlike the offline [Voxtral](./voxtral) model which processes complete audio files, VoxtralRealtime is architected for low-latency, incremental transcription by processing audio in chunks as they arrive.\r\n\r\nThe model combines an audio encoder with a Mistral-based language model decoder, using time conditioning embeddings and causal convolutions with padding caches to enable efficient streaming inference.\r\n\r\n* Add Voxtral Realtime (#43769) by @eustlb\r\n\r\n### GLM-5 - GlmMoeDsa\r\n\r\n<img width=\"947\" height=\"638\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c4fff37-7f40-4e86-b4a0-db718f45c93b\" />\r\n\r\nThe zAI team launches GLM-5, and introduces it as such:\r\n\r\n> GLM-5, targeting complex systems engineering and long-horizon agentic tasks. Scaling is still one of the most important ways to improve the intelligence efficiency of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Compared to GLM-4.5, GLM-5 scales from 355B parameters (32B active) to 744B parameters (40B active), and increases pre-training data from 23T to 28.5T tokens. GLM-5 also integrates DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA), largely reducing deployment cost while preserving long-context capacity.\r\n> \r\n> Reinforcement learning aims to bridge the gap between competence and excellence in pre-trained models. However, deploying it at scale for LLMs is a challenge due to the RL training inefficiency. To this end, we developed [slime](https://github.com/THUDM/slime), a novel asynchronous RL infrastructure that substantially improves training throughput and efficiency, enabling more fine-grained post-training iterations. With advances in both pre-training and post-training, GLM-5 delivers significant improvement compared to GLM-4.7 across a wide range of academic benchmarks and achieves best-in-class performance among all open-source models in the world on reasoning, coding, and agentic tasks, closing the gap with frontier models.\r\n\r\n* Add GlmMoeDsa (#43858) by @Cyrilvallez\r\n\r\n### Qwen3.5, Qwen3.5 Moe\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b56dcaca-80e7-4b22-80a5-2f767bb65095\" />\r\n\r\nThe Qwen team launches Qwen 3.5, and introduces it as such:\r\n\r\n> We are delighted to announce the official release of Qwen3.5, introducing the open-weight of the first model in the Qwen3.5 series, namely Qwen3.5-397B-A17B. As a native vision-language model, Qwen3.5-397B-A17B demonstrates outstanding results across a full range of benchmark evaluations, including reasoning, coding, agent capabilities, and multimodal understanding, empowering developers and enterprises to achieve significantly greater productivity. Built on an innovative hybrid architecture that fuses linear attention (via Gated Delta Networks) with a sparse mixture-of-experts, the model attains remarkable inference efficiency: although it comprises 397 billion total parameters, just 17 billion are activated per forward pass, optimizing both speed and cost without sacrificing capability. We have also expanded our language and dialect support from 119 to 201, providing broader accessibility and enhanced support to users around the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Adding Support for Qwen3.5 (#43830) by @bozheng-hit\r\n\r\n### VibeVoice Acoustic Tokenizer\r\n\r\n<img width=\"821\" height=\"349\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1433597-b43b-4d2d-a2c7-216d7792b8c9\" />\r\n\r\n[VibeVoice](https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.19205) is a novel framework for synthesizing high-fidelity, long-form speech with multiple speakers by employing a next-token diffusion approach within a Large Language Model (LLM) structure.

The config.encoder.text_config was not getting its attn set because we aren't passing it to PreTrainedModel.__init__. We can't change the model structure without breaking so I manually re-added a call to self.adjust_attn_implemetation in modeling code\r\n\r\n* 🚨 Generation cache preparation (#43679) - Refactors cache initialization in generation to ensure sliding window configurations are now properly respected. Previously, some models (like Afmoe) created caches without passing the model config, causing sliding window limits to be ignored. This is breaking because models with sliding window attention will now enforce their window size limits during generation, which may change generation behavior or require adjusting sequence lengths in existing code.\r\n\r\n* 🚨 Delete duplicate code in backbone utils (#43323) - This PR cleans up backbone utilities. Specifically, we have currently 5 different config attr to decide which backbone to load, most of which can be merged into one and seem redundant\r\nAfter this PR, we'll have only one config.backbone_config as a single source of truth. The models will load the backbone from_config and load pretrained weights only if the checkpoint has any weights saved. The overall idea is same as in other composite models. A few config arguments are removed as a result.\r\n\r\n* 🚨 Refactor DETR to updated standards (#41549) - standardizes the DETR model to be closer to other vision models in the library.\r\n\r\n* 🚨Fix floating-point precision in JanusImageProcessor resize (#43187) - replaces an `int()` with `round()`, expect light numerical differences \r\n\r\n* 🚨 Remove deprecated AnnotionFormat (#42983) - removes a missnamed class in favour of `AnnotationFormat`. \r\n\r\n## Bugfixes and improvements\r\n\r\n* fix(models): Migrate legacy segmentation_indices to out_indices in BeitConfig (#43505) by @harshaljanjani\r\n* [docs] Update torch version (#42135) by @stevhliu\r\n* Remove SDPA workarounds for torch 2.4+ (#43754) by @cyyever\r\n* add use_deterministic to guarantee the consistency for youtu-llm model (#43759) by @kaixuanliu\r\n* fix: add compatible_model_types to suppress model type mismatch warnings (#43495) by @leoneperdigao\r\n* Fix T5 v1.1 detection (#43681) by @githubnemo\r\n* Add moonshine streaming (#43702) by @eustlb\r\n* Allow bi-directional attention for all models (#43705) by @Cyrilvallez\r\n* Docs: fix Training step by removing tokenizer from trainer initialization (#43733) by @nesjett\r\n* Fix scheduler initialization order (#43711) by @SunMarc\r\n* Fix accelerate integration import  (#43732) by @SunMarc\r\n* Update torch minimum version to 2.4 (#41307) by @cyyever\r\n* Fix dtype in image-text-to-text pipe (#43731) by @zucchini-nlp\r\n* Preventing initialization of siglip's lecun_normal_, default_flax_embed_init in ZeRO3 (#43574) by @jp1924\r\n* fix: AttributeError for Qwen3_omni_moe (#43593) by @Vallabh-1504\r\n* Improve typing/explanations for general model properties (#43712) by @Cyrilvallez\r\n* [Kernels] kernel migration updates for activation kernels (#43518) by @ariG23498\r\n* [`feat`] Allow loading T5Gemma2Encoder with AutoModel (#43559) by @tomaarsen\r\n* Added S110 - try-except-pass rule (#43687) by @tarekziade\r\n* [docs] benchmarks (#43694) by @stevhliu\r\n* fix norm_eps dtype (#43669) by @fschlatt\r\n* Llava onevision: output align for tests and add `image_sizes` input param (#43678) by @kaixuanliu\r\n* Fix CLIPOutput attentions not being returned (#43657) by @jonathan-fulton\r\n* [`Attn`] Fixup interface usage after refactor (#43706) by @vasqu\r\n* Fix model/processor mismatch in SigLIP2 quantization example (#43652) by @jonathan-fulton\r\n* Fix crash of custom models in Notebook or Repl (#43690) by @Cyrilvallez\r\n* Simplify TrainingArguments docstring (#43568) by @SunMarc\r\n* Composite model inherit automatically all important properties from their children (#43691) by @Cyrilvallez\r\n* Update configuration_qwen3.py (#43703) by @francesco-bertolotti\r\n* fix gptoss tp crash (#43695) by @sywangyi\r\n* [CB] Keep order of incoming requests (#43626) by @remi-or\r\n* Fix Apertus model loading (NotImplementedError: Cannot copy out of meta tensor; no data!)

      "content": "Hey HN! We&#x27;re Nithin and Nikhil, twin brothers building BrowserOS (YC S24). We&#x27;re an open-source, privacy-first alternative to the AI browsers from big labs.<p>The big differentiator: on BrowserOS you can use local LLMs or BYOK and run the agent entirely on the client side, so your company&#x2F;sensitive data stays on your machine!<p>Today we&#x27;re launching filesystem access... just like Claude Cowork, our browser agent can read files, write files, run shell commands! But honestly, we didn&#x27;t plan for this. It turns out the privacy decision we made 9 months ago accidentally positioned us for this moment.<p>The architectural bet we made 9 months ago: Unlike other AI browsers (ChatGPT Atlas, Perplexity Comet) where the agent loop runs server-side, we decided early on to run our agent entirely on your machine (client side).<p>But building everything on the client side wasn&#x27;t smooth. We initially built our agent loop inside a Chrome extension. But we kept hitting walls -- service worker being single thread JS; not having access to NodeJS libraries. So we made the hard decision 2 months ago to throw away everything and start from scratch.<p>In the new architecture, our agent loop sits in a standalone binary that we ship alongside our Chromium. And we use gemini-cli for the agent loop with some tweaks! We wrote a neat adapter to translate between Gemini format and Vercel AI SDK format. You can look at our entire codebase here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.new&#x2F;browseros-agent\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.new&#x2F;browseros-agent</a><p>How we give browser access to filesystem: When Claude Cowork launched, we realized something: because Atlas and Comet run their agent loop server-side, there&#x27;s no good way for their agent to access your files without uploading them to the server first. But our agent was already local. Adding filesystem access meant just... opening the door (with your permissions ofc). Our agent can now read and write files just like Claude Code.<p>What you can actually do today:<p>a) Organize files in my desktop folder <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;NOZ7xjto6Uc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;NOZ7xjto6Uc</a><p>b) Open top 5 HN links, extract the details and write summary into a HTML file <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;uXvqs_TCmMQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;uXvqs_TCmMQ</a><p>--- Where we are now\nIf you haven&#x27;t tried us since the last Show HN (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=44523409\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=44523409</a>), give us another shot. The new architecture unlocked a ton of new features, and we&#x27;ve grown to 8.5K GitHub stars and 100K+ downloads:<p>c) You can now build more reliable workflows using n8n-like graph <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;H_bFfWIevSY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;H_bFfWIevSY</a><p>d) You can also use BrowserOS as an MCP server in Cursor or Claude Code <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;5nevh00lckM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;5nevh00lckM</a><p>We are very bullish on browser being the right platform for a Claude Cowork like agent. Browser is the most commonly used app by knowledge workers (emails, docs, spreadsheets, research, etc). And even Anthropic recognizes this -- for Claude Cowork, they have janky integration with browser via a chrome extension. But owning the entire stack allows us to build differentiated features that wouldn&#x27;t be possible otherwise. Ex:  Browser ACLs.<p>Agents can do dumb or destructive things, so we&#x27;re adding browser-level guardrails (think IAM for agents): &quot;role(agent): can never click buy&quot; or &quot;role(agent): read-only access on my bank&#x27;s homepage.&quot;<p>Curious to hear your take on this and the overall thesis.<p>We’ll be in the comments.
