One of its best features is the ability to sync your usage across devices, giving you a complete picture over different time periods. It respects your privacy by only collecting aggregated usage data. No conversation or code details are ever touched.<p>There has been some controversy around tracking usage and whether it might lead to price hikes or limits, but honestly, Anthropic probably already knows this data. The app is more about helping you optimise your workflow, not exposing anything sensitive. It also includes a ranking system so you can get a sense of how others are using Claude Code and maybe learn from their patterns.<p>I built it with a solid backend architecture to be scalable and responsive, running on a small Kubernetes cluster. The goal is to help people like us understand and improve how we work with Claude Code, all wrapped up in a simple web and CLI interface.",

VaultGemma is available as a pretrained model with 1B parameters that uses a 1024 token sequence length.\r\n\r\nVaultGemma was trained from scratch with sequence-level differential privacy (DP). Its training data includes the same mixture as the [Gemma 2 models](https://huggingface.co/collections/google/gemma-2-release-667d6600fd5220e7b967f315), consisting of a number of documents of varying lengths. Additionally, it is trained using [DP stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00133) and provides a (ε ≤ 2.0, δ ≤ 1.1e-10)-sequence-level DP guarantee, where a sequence consists of 1024 consecutive tokens extracted from heterogeneous data sources. Specifically, the privacy unit of the guarantee is for the sequences after sampling and packing of the mixture.\r\n\r\n* add: differential privacy research model  by @RyanMullins in #40851\r\n\r\n### Qwen3 VL\r\n\r\n<img width=\"3544\" height=\"1886\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5afa70cb-506e-4d56-baa3-30e7522ac653\" />\r\n\r\n[Qwen3-VL](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13923) is a multimodal vision-language model series, encompassing both dense and MoE variants, as well as Instruct and Thinking versions. \r\n\r\nBuilding upon its predecessors, Qwen3-VL delivers significant improvements in visual understanding while maintaining strong pure text capabilities. Key architectural advancements include: enhanced MRope with interleaved layout for better spatial-temporal modeling, DeepStack integration to effectively leverage multi-level features from the Vision Transformer (ViT), and improved video understanding through text-based time alignment—evolving from T-RoPE to text timestamp alignment for more precise temporal grounding. \r\n\r\nThese innovations collectively enable Qwen3-VL to achieve superior performance in complex multimodal tasks.\r\n\r\n* Adding Support for Qwen3-VL Series  by @JJJYmmm in #40795\r\n\r\n### Longcat Flash\r\n\r\n<img width=\"763\" height=\"468\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/289d33e0-6c71-458d-ae07-b7d454ac2adf\" />\r\n\r\nThe LongCatFlash model was proposed in [LongCat-Flash Technical Report](https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.01322) by the Meituan LongCat Team.

The model features a shortcut-connected architecture enabling high inference speed (>100 tokens/second) and advanced reasoning capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe abstract from the paper is the following:\r\n\r\n*We present LongCat-Flash, a 560 billion parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model featuring a dynamic computation mechanism that activates 18.6B-31.3B parameters based on context (average ~27B).

FlexOlmo employs a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture where each expert is trained independently on closed datasets and later integrated through a new domain-informed routing without any joint training. FlexOlmo is trained on FlexMix, a corpus we curate comprising publicly available datasets alongside seven domain-specific sets, representing realistic approximations of closed sets. \r\n\r\nYou can find all the original FlexOlmo checkpoints under the [FlexOlmo](https://huggingface.co/collections/allenai/flexolmo-68471177a386b6e20a54c55f) collection.\r\n\r\n* Add FlexOlmo model  by @2015aroras in #40921\r\n\r\n### LFM2 VL\r\n\r\n<img width=\"2300\" height=\"1400\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef0605cd-9512-458c-915a-62316e14d90c\" />\r\n\r\n[LFM2-VL](https://www.liquid.ai/blog/lfm2-vl-efficient-vision-language-models) first series of vision-language foundation models developed by [Liquid AI](https://liquid.ai/). These multimodal models are designed for low-latency and device-aware deployment. LFM2-VL extends the LFM2 family of open-weight Liquid Foundation Models (LFMs) into the vision-language space, supporting both text and image inputs with variable resolutions.\r\n\r\n#### Architecture\r\n\r\nLFM2-VL consists of three main components: a language model backbone, a vision encoder, and a multimodal projector. LFM2-VL builds upon the LFM2 backbone, inheriting from either LFM2-1.2B (for LFM2-VL-1.6B) or LFM2-350M (for LFM2-VL-450M). For the vision tower, LFM2-VL uses SigLIP2 NaFlex encoders to convert input images into token sequences. Two variants are implemented:\r\n* Shape-optimized (400M) for more fine-grained vision capabilities for LFM2-VL-1.6B\r\n* Base (86M) for fast image processing for LFM2-VL-450M\r\n\r\nThe encoder processes images at their native resolution up to 512×512 pixels, efficiently handling smaller images without upscaling and supporting non-standard aspect ratios without distortion. Larger images are split into non-overlapping square patches of 512×512 each, preserving detail. In LFM2-VL-1.6B, the model also receives a thumbnail (a small, downscaled version of the original image capturing the overall scene) to enhance global context understanding and alignment. Special tokens mark each patch’s position and indicate the thumbnail’s start. The multimodal connector is a 2-layer MLP connector with pixel unshuffle to reduce image token count. \r\n\r\n* Add new model LFM2-VL  by @zucchini-nlp in #40624\r\n\r\n### BLT\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1448\" height=\"1062\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af1fbb09-082c-4331-9217-357adb506cbf\" />\r\n\r\nThe BLT model was proposed in [Byte Latent Transformer: Patches Scale Better Than Tokens](<https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09871>) by Artidoro Pagnoni, Ram Pasunuru, Pedro Rodriguez, John Nguyen, Benjamin Muller, Margaret Li1, Chunting Zhou, Lili Yu, Jason Weston, Luke Zettlemoyer, Gargi Ghosh, Mike Lewis, Ari Holtzman†, Srinivasan Iyer.\r\nBLT is a byte-level LLM that achieves tokenization-level performance through entropy-based dynamic patching.\r\n\r\nThe abstract from the paper is the following:\r\n\r\n*We introduce the Byte Latent Transformer (BLT), a new byte-level LLM architecture that, for the first time, matches tokenization-based LLM performance at scale with significant improvements in inference\r\nefficiency and robustness. BLT encodes bytes into dynamically sized patches, which serve as the primary units of computation. Patches are segmented based on the entropy of the next byte, allocating\r\nmore compute and model capacity where increased data complexity demands it. We present the first flop controlled scaling study of byte-level models up to 8B parameters and 4T training bytes. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of scaling models trained on raw bytes without a fixed vocabulary. Both training and inference efficiency improve due to dynamically selecting long patches when data is predictable, along with qualitative improvements on reasoning and long tail generalization. Overall, for fixed inference costs, BLT shows significantly better scaling than tokenization-based models, by simultaneously growing both patch and model size.*\r\n\r\n#### Usage Tips:\r\n\r\n- **Dual Model Architecture**: BLT consists of two separate trained models:\r\n  - **Patcher (Entropy Model)**: A smaller transformer model that predicts byte-level entropy to determine patch boundaries and segment input.\r\n  - **Main Transformer Model**: The primary model that processes the patches through a Local Encoder, Global Transformer, and Local Decoder.\r\n\r\n- **Dynamic Patching**: The model uses entropy-based dynamic patching where:\r\n  - High-entropy regions (complex data) get shorter patches with more computational attention\r\n  - Low-entropy regions (predictable data) get longer patches for efficiency\r\n  - This allows the model to allocate compute resources where they're most needed\r\n\r\n- **Local Encoder**: Processes byte sequences with cross-attention to patch embeddings\r\n- **Global Transformer**: Processes patch-level representations with full attention across patches\r\n- **Local Decoder**: Generates output with cross-attention back to the original byte sequence\r\n\r\n- **Byte-Level Tokenizer**: Unlike traditional tokenizers that use learned vocabularies, BLT's tokenizer simply converts text to UTF-8 bytes and maps each byte to a token ID. There is no need for a vocabulary.\r\n\r\n* blt wip  by @itazap in #38579\r\n\r\n### Qwen3 Omni MoE\r\n\r\n<img width=\"14084\" height=\"7429\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20d46a43-15f2-42bf-9703-9575f5ca4430\" />\r\n\r\nThe [Qwen2.5-Omni](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-omni/) model is a unified multiple modalities model proposed in [Qwen2.5-Omni Technical Report](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.20215) from Qwen team, Alibaba Group.\r\n\r\n#### Notes\r\n\r\n- Use [`Qwen2_5OmniForConditionalGeneration`] to generate audio and text output. To generate only one output type, use [`Qwen2_5OmniThinkerForConditionalGeneration`] for text-only and [`Qwen2_5OmniTalkersForConditionalGeneration`] for audio-only outputs.\r\n- Audio generation with [`Qwen2_5OmniForConditionalGeneration`] supports only single batch size at the moment.\r\n- In case out out-of-memory errors hwen working with video input, decrease `processor.max_pixels`. By default the maximum is set to a very arge value and high resolution visuals will not be resized, unless resolution exceeds `processor.max_pixels`.\r\n- The processor has its own [`~ProcessorMixin.apply_chat_template`] method to convert chat messages to model inputs.\r\n\r\n* Adding support for Qwen3Omni  by @BakerBunker in #41025\r\n\r\n### Parakeet\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1431\" height=\"527\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e831f451-9be3-4b5c-a222-b833a50ceb2a\" />\r\n\r\nParakeet models, [introduced by NVIDIA NeMo](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/pushing-the-boundaries-of-speech-recognition-with-nemo-parakeet-asr-models/), are models that combine a [Fast Conformer](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/nemotoolkit/asr/models.html#fast-conformer) encoder with connectionist temporal classification (CTC), recurrent neural network transducer (RNNT) or token and duration transducer (TDT) decoder for automatic speech recognition.\r\n\r\n**Model Architecture**\r\n- **Fast Conformer Encoder**: A linearly scalable Conformer architecture that processes mel-spectrogram features and reduces sequence length through subsampling.

The main use case for CB is batched generation, which makes it very efficient in the context of GRPO training or evaluation. Thanks to CB, researchers or model developers are now free to use transformers in these contexts without having to spin up an additional inference engine. \r\n\r\nCB currently supports both full attention and sliding window attention: this means that the vast majority of models are supported, like llama, gemma3, gpt-oss. \r\n\r\nCB is also integrated with transformers serve, which means that you can deploy transformers as an OpenAI-compatible HTTP server.\r\nHere is a small snippet on how to use it:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport datasets\r\nimport torch\r\n\r\nfrom transformers import

      "content": "Hi, We’ve built Pantheon-CLI, an fully open-source project that aims to be the “Python Claude Code + Notebook” — but designed for data analysis instead of just coding.<p>Unlike most AI coding assistants, Pantheon-CLI runs entirely on your machine (or server). No data upload required. It blends natural language and code in a single workflow, keeping variables in memory and letting you switch seamlessly between typing code and asking in plain English.<p>What it does:\n1. Chat with your data: Directly process CSV, Excel, AnnData, Pickle, Torch tensors, or any format supported by Python&#x2F;R&#x2F;Julia.\n2. Mixed programming: Variables persist across natural language and code; the CLI auto-generates and runs code for you.\n3. MCP-like agent integration: Read&#x2F;create files, run commands, fetch web pages, generate&#x2F;revise code.\n4. Human-like learning: Feed it a PDF paper or tutorial—Pantheon-CLI reads it, plans steps, and replicates methods before analysis.\n5. Task planning: Builds scientific agents by learning from papers&#x2F;tutorials (not just fixed, human-predefined steps).\n6. Multi-model support: Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, DeepSeek, Qwen, etc. + offline local LLMs (ollama, deepseek, gpt-oss).\n7. Multi-RAG support: Pre-learns from docs&#x2F;web into a local “brain” for more credible outputs without massive token costs.\n8. Built-in biology toolsets: For omics analysis (alignment, annotation, differential expression, full paper reproduction).\n9. Notebook mode: Brings the same agentic workflow into Jupyter—automatically runs and revises code, operates on files, and learns from tutorials&#x2F;papers.<p>Pantheon-CLI is our attempt to push beyond “AI writes code for you.” Instead, it’s an agentic operating system for data analysis, spanning both terminal and notebook.<p>Repo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aristoteleo&#x2F;pantheon-cli\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aristoteleo&#x2F;pantheon-cli</a><p>Tutorial: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pantheonos.stanford.edu&#x2F;cli&#x2F;docs&#x2F;intro&#x2F;getting-started\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pantheonos.stanford.edu&#x2F;cli&#x2F;docs&#x2F;intro&#x2F;getting-start...</a><p>Home page: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pantheonos.stanford.edu&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pantheonos.stanford.edu&#x2F;</a><p>Would love to hear feedback from the HN community—what use cases would you try this for, and what features would make it more useful to you?",
