One of its best features is the ability to sync your usage across devices, giving you a complete picture over different time periods. It respects your privacy by only collecting aggregated usage data. No conversation or code details are ever touched.<p>There has been some controversy around tracking usage and whether it might lead to price hikes or limits, but honestly, Anthropic probably already knows this data. The app is more about helping you optimise your workflow, not exposing anything sensitive. It also includes a ranking system so you can get a sense of how others are using Claude Code and maybe learn from their patterns.<p>I built it with a solid backend architecture to be scalable and responsive, running on a small Kubernetes cluster. The goal is to help people like us understand and improve how we work with Claude Code, all wrapped up in a simple web and CLI interface.",

It comprises two models: a big one with 117B parameters ([gpt-oss-120b](https://hf.co/openai/gpt-oss-120b)), and a smaller one with 21B parameters ([gpt-oss-20b](https://hf.co/openai/gpt-oss-20b)). Both are mixture-of-experts (MoEs) and use a 4-bit quantization scheme (MXFP4), enabling fast inference (thanks to fewer active parameters, see details below) while keeping resource usage low. The large model fits on a single H100 GPU, while the small one runs within 16GB of memory and is perfect for consumer hardware and on-device applications.\r\n\r\n### Overview of Capabilities and Architecture\r\n\r\n- 21B and 117B total parameters, with 3.6B and 5.1B active parameters, respectively.\r\n- 4-bit quantization scheme using [mxfp4](https://www.opencompute.org/documents/ocp-microscaling-formats-mx-v1-0-spec-final-pdf) format. Only applied on the MoE weights. As stated, the 120B fits in a single 80 GB GPU and the 20B fits in a single 16GB GPU.\r\n- Reasoning, text-only models; with chain-of-thought and adjustable reasoning effort levels.\r\n- Instruction following and tool use support.\r\n- Inference implementations using transformers, vLLM, llama.cpp, and ollama.\r\n- [Responses API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses) is recommended for inference.\r\n- License: Apache 2.0, with a small complementary use policy.\r\n\r\n### Architecture\r\n\r\n- Token-choice MoE with SwiGLU activations.\r\n- When calculating the MoE weights, a softmax is taken over selected experts (softmax-after-topk).\r\n- Each attention layer uses RoPE with 128K context.\r\n- Alternate attention layers: full-context, and sliding 128-token window.\r\n- Attention layers use a learned attention sink per-head, where the denominator of the softmax has an additional additive value.\r\n- It uses the same tokenizer as GPT-4o and other OpenAI API models.\r\n- Some new tokens have been incorporated to enable compatibility with the Responses API.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following snippet shows simple inference with the 20B model. It runs on 16 GB GPUs when using mxfp4, or ~48 GB in bfloat16.\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\r\n\r\nmodel_id = \"openai/gpt-oss-20b\"\r\n\r\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)\r\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\r\n    model_id,\r\n    device_map=\"auto\",\r\n    torch_dtype=\"auto\",\r\n)\r\n\r\nmessages = [\r\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"How many rs are in the word 'strawberry'?\"},\r\n]  \r\n\r\ninputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\r\n    messages,\r\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\r\n    return_tensors=\"pt\",\r\n    return_dict=True,\r\n).to(model.device)\r\n\r\ngenerated = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=100)\r\nprint(tokenizer.decode(generated[0][inputs[\"input_ids\"].shape[-1]:]))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Flash Attention 3\r\n\r\nThe models use attention sinks, a technique the vLLM team made compatible with Flash Attention 3. We have packaged and integrated their optimized kernel in [kernels-community/vllm-flash-attn3](https://huggingface.co/kernels-community/vllm-flash-attn3). At the time of writing, this super-fast kernel has been tested on Hopper cards with PyTorch 2.7 and 2.8. We expect increased coverage in the coming days. If you run the models on Hopper cards (for example, H100 or H200), you need to pip install –upgrade kernels and add the following line to your snippet:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\r\n\r\nmodel_id = \"openai/gpt-oss-20b\"\r\n\r\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)\r\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\r\n    model_id,\r\n    device_map=\"auto\",\r\n    torch_dtype=\"auto\",\r\n+    # Flash Attention with Sinks\r\n+    attn_implementation=\"kernels-community/vllm-flash-attn3\",\r\n)  \r\n\r\nmessages = [\r\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"How many rs are in the word 'strawberry'?\"},\r\n]\r\n\r\ninputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\r\n    messages,\r\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\r\n    return_tensors=\"pt\",\r\n    return_dict=True,\r\n).to(model.device)\r\n\r\ngenerated = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=100)\r\nprint(tokenizer.decode(generated[0][inputs[\"input_ids\"].shape[-1]:]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven though the 120B model fits on a single H100 GPU (using mxfp4), you can also run it easily on multiple GPUs using accelerate or torchrun. Transformers provides a default parallelization plan, and you can leverage optimized attention kernels as well. The following snippet can be run with torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 generate.py on a system with 4 GPUs:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\r\nfrom transformers.distributed import DistributedConfig\r\nimport torch\r\n\r\nmodel_path = \"openai/gpt-oss-120b\"\r\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path, padding_side=\"left\")\r\n\r\ndevice_map = {\r\n    \"tp_plan\": \"auto\",    # Enable Tensor Parallelism\r\n}\r\n\r\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\r\n    model_path,\r\n    torch_dtype=\"auto\",\r\n    attn_implementation=\"kernels-community/vllm-flash-attn3\",\r\n    **device_map,\r\n)\r\n\r\nmessages = [\r\n     {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Explain how expert parallelism works in large language models.\"}\r\n]\r\n\r\ninputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\r\n    messages,\r\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\r\n    return_tensors=\"pt\",\r\n    return_dict=True,\r\n).to(model.device)\r\n\r\noutputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=1000)\r\n\r\n# Decode and print\r\nresponse = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0])\r\nprint(\"Model response:\", response.split(\"<|channel|>final<|message|>\")[-1].strip())\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other optimizations\r\n\r\nIf you have a Hopper GPU or better, we recommend you use mxfp4 for the reasons explained above. If you can additionally use Flash Attention 3, then by all means do enable it! \r\n\r\n> [!TIP]\r\n> If your GPU is not compatible with mxfp4, then we recommend you use MegaBlocks MoE kernels for a nice speed bump. To do so, you just need to adjust your inference code like this:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\r\n\r\nmodel_id = \"openai/gpt-oss-20b\"\r\n\r\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)\r\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\r\n    model_id,\r\n    device_map=\"auto\",\r\n    torch_dtype=\"auto\",\r\n+    # Optimize MoE layers with downloadable MegaBlocksMoeMLP\r\n+    use_kernels=True,\r\n)\r\n\r\nmessages = [\r\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"How many rs are in the word 'strawberry'?\"},\r\n]\r\n\r\ninputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\r\n    messages,\r\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\r\n    tokenize=True,\r\n    return_tensors=\"pt\",\r\n    return_dict=True,\r\n).to(model.device)\r\n\r\ngenerated = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=100)\r\nprint(tokenizer.decode(generated[0][inputs[\"input_ids\"].shape[-1]:]))\r\n```\r\n\r\n> [!TIP]\r\n> MegaBlocks optimized MoE kernels require the model to run on bfloat16, so memory consumption will be higher than running on mxfp4. We recommend you use mxfp4 if you can, otherwise opt in to MegaBlocks via use_kernels=True.\r\n\r\n### transformers serve\r\n\r\nYou can use transformers serve to experiment locally with the models, without any other dependencies. You can launch the server with just:\r\ntransformers serve\r\n\r\nTo which you can send requests using the Responses API. \r\n```\r\n# responses API\r\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/responses \\\r\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\r\n-d '{\"input\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"hello\"}], \"temperature\": 1.0, \"stream\": true, \"model\": \"openai/gpt-oss-120b\"}'\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also send requests using the standard Completions API:\r\n```\r\n# completions API\r\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \\\r\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\r\n-d '{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"hello\"}], \"temperature\": 1.0, \"max_tokens\": 1000, \"stream\": true, \"model\": \"openai/gpt-oss-120b\"}'\r\n```\r\n## Command A Vision\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1920\" height=\"960\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5502cc65-2fc9-49ac-8e15-262aa573b68d\" />\r\n\r\nCommand A Vision is a state-of-the-art multimodal model designed to seamlessly integrate visual and textual information for a wide range of applications.
