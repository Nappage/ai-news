This tag is a tagged version of the `main` branch and does not follow semantic versioning. This model will be included in the next minor release: `v4.53.0`.\r\n\r\n## Kyutai-STT\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/eustlb/documentation-images/resolve/main/kyutai_stt.png\"/>\r\n\r\nKyutai STT is a speech-to-text model architecture based on the [Mimi codec](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/mimi), which encodes audio into discrete tokens in a streaming fashion, and a [Moshi-like](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/moshi) autoregressive decoder. Kyutai’s lab has released two model checkpoints:\r\n- [kyutai/stt-1b-en_fr](https://huggingface.co/kyutai/stt-1b-en_fr): a 1B-parameter model capable of transcribing both English and French\r\n- [kyutai/stt-2.6b-en](https://huggingface.co/kyutai/stt-2.6b-en): a 2.6B-parameter model focused solely on English, optimized for maximum transcription accuracy\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage example\r\n\r\nKyutai-STT can be found on the [Huggingface Hub](https://huggingface.co/models?other=stt).\r\n\r\n### Inference\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport torch\r\nfrom datasets import load_dataset, Audio\r\nfrom transformers import KyutaiSpeechToTextProcessor, KyutaiSpeechToTextForConditionalGeneration\r\n\r\n# 1. load the model and the processor\r\ntorch_device = \"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\"\r\nmodel_id = \"kyutai/stt-2.6b-en\"\r\n\r\nprocessor = KyutaiSpeechToTextProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id)\r\nmodel = KyutaiSpeechToTextForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_id, device_map=torch_device)\r\n\r\n# 2. load audio samples\r\nds = load_dataset(\r\n    \"hf-internal-testing/librispeech_asr_dummy\", \"clean\", split=\"validation\"\r\n)\r\nds = ds.cast_column(\"audio\", Audio(sampling_rate=24000))\r\n\r\n# 3. prepare the model inputs\r\ninputs = processor(\r\n    ds[0][\"audio\"][\"array\"],\r\n)\r\ninputs.to(torch_device)\r\n\r\n# 4. infer the model\r\noutput_tokens = model.generate(**inputs)\r\n\r\n# 5. decode the generated tokens\r\nprint(processor.batch_decode(output_tokens, skip_special_tokens=True))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Batched Inference\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport torch\r\nfrom datasets import load_dataset, Audio\r\nfrom transformers import KyutaiSpeechToTextProcessor, KyutaiSpeechToTextForConditionalGeneration\r\n\r\n# 1. load the model and the processor\r\ntorch_device = \"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\"\r\nmodel_id = \"kyutai/stt-2.6b-en\"\r\n\r\nprocessor = KyutaiSpeechToTextProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id)\r\nmodel = KyutaiSpeechToTextForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_id, device_map=torch_device)\r\n\r\n# 2. load audio samples\r\nds = load_dataset(\r\n    \"hf-internal-testing/librispeech_asr_dummy\", \"clean\", split=\"validation\"\r\n)\r\nds = ds.cast_column(\"audio\", Audio(sampling_rate=24000))\r\n\r\n# 3. prepare the model inputs\r\naudio_arrays = [ds[i][\"audio\"][\"array\"] for i in range(4)]\r\ninputs = processor(audio_arrays, return_tensors=\"pt\", padding=True)\r\ninputs = inputs.to(torch_device)\r\n\r\n# 4. infer the model\r\noutput_tokens = model.generate(**inputs)\r\n\r\n# 5. decode the generated tokens\r\ndecoded_outputs = processor.batch_decode(output_tokens, skip_special_tokens=True)\r\nfor output in decoded_outputs:\r\n    print(output)\r\n```",

      "content": "This ask post is very opinionated.<p>I used be a die-hard Google&#x2F;GCP lover, from wanting to enter Google as an engineer when I was a student, to proposing to try out GCP for a new project at my first internship (and succeeded). Used Firebase for my on-campus goods trading platform, course projects, and contract projects, and got good experiences. I also used Colab as my go-to choice for my study of machine learning, running models for tasks including object detection, image segmentation, basic machine learning projects, and fine-tuning transformer models for my NLP course projects.<p>I still remembered the release Google&#x27;s LaMDA model in 2021, and the beautiful blog post site. They used to be the leading role in GenAI or AI serving in general with TensorFlow serve on GCP. However, ever since last year, I really felt that Google is severely lagging behind in the cloud service or GenAI in general.<p>For GCP, especially the AI related workspace, I see no meaningful improvement over the years. The file system still has a weird triangle that when you click it does nothing, the UI is extremely laggy when the data is huge just like in colab. I don&#x27;t even want to mention the accidental deletion of Unisuper&#x27;s data.<p>For Gemini, despite it has large context window (2M for 1.5 Pro, 1M for 1.5 Flash), I see no value at all to use this. I generally judge a service&#x27;s usability on three things: model competency &gt; API (design, price, speed) &gt; playground ease of use (because you can always use other playgrounds when you have the API). Gemini sucks on every aspect. It&#x27;s never in par with GPT-4o (opinionated, tested on all my graduate CS quiz questions). The API is such a pain in the ass (500, 400 all over the place when I was following the cookbook and Gemini&#x27;s team could not even solve my issue at a hackathon!) They playground is the most counter-intuitive thing I&#x27;ve ever used in my life.<p>What&#x27;s more, the executive team of the Google seems to believe that Gemini 1.5 Pro is as satisfying as GPT-4, and Gemini 1.5 Flash is better, faster, and cheaper than GPT-3.5. First statement is false (to me). Second statement is meaningless, because you should be comparing Gemini 1.5 Flash to Llama 3 or Mistral instead of GPT-3.5. Don&#x27;t even bring up that Gemini is not fine-tunable at this moment.<p>They have a slide number that over 60% GenAI startup is using GCP. I simply don&#x27;t understand where this number is from. Almost every startup I encountered is either using OpenAI or Azure Studio (if they have some scale). I used to be a MSFT hater, but Azure AI Studio just has far better DX and model catalog compared to Vertex AI.<p>Therefore, unless my company has already signed a contract with GCP, I really don&#x27;t see the point of a new startup starting to use GCP or Gemini in general.",

      "content": "Hello, we are Shikha and Sourabh, founders of UpTrain(YC W23) - an open-source tool to evaluate the performance of your LLM applications on aspects such as correctness, tonality, hallucination, fluency, etc.<p>The Problem: Unlike traditional Machine learning or Deep learning models where we always have a unique Ground Truth and can define metrics like Precision, Recall, accuracy, etc. to quantify the model’s performance, LLMs are trickier and it is very difficult to estimate if their response is correct or not. If you are using GPT-4 to write a recruitment email, there is no unique correct email to do a word-to-word comparison against.<p>As you build an LLM application, you want to compare it against different model providers, prompt configurations, etc., and figure out the best working combination. Instead of manually skimming through a couple of model responses, you want to run them through hundreds of test cases, aggregate their scores, and make an informed decision. Additionally, as your application generates responses for real user queries, you don’t want to wait for them to complain about the model inaccuracy, instead, you want to monitor the model’s performance over time and get alerted in case of any drifts.<p>Again, at the core of it, you want a tool to evaluate the quality of your LLM response and assign quantitative scores.<p>The Solution: To solve this, we are building UpTrain which has a set of evaluation metrics so that you can know when your application is going wrong. These metrics include traditional NLP metrics like Rogue, Bleu, etc., embeddings similarity metrics as well as model grading scores i.e. where we use LLMs to evaluate different aspects of your response. A few of these evaluation metrics include:<p>1. Response Relevancy: Measures if the response contains any irrelevant information\n2. Response Completeness: Measures if the response answers all aspects of the given question\n3. Factual Accuracy: Measures hallucinations i.e. if the response has any made-up information or not with respect to the provided context\n4. Retrieved Context Quality: Measures if the retrieved context has sufficient information to answer the given question\n5. Response Tonality: Measures if the response aligns with a specific persona or desired tone\netc.<p>We have designed workflows so that you can easily add your testing dataset, configure which checks you want to run (you can also define custom checks suitable for your use case) and conveniently access the results via Streamlit dashboards.<p>UpTrain also has experimentation capabilities where you can specify different prompt variations and models to test across and use these quantitative checks to find the best configuration for your application.<p>You can also use UpTrain to monitor your application’s performance and find avenues for improvement. We integrate directly with your databases (BigQuery, Postgres, MongoDB, etc.) and can run daily evaluations.<p>We’ve launched the tool under an Apache 2.0 license to make it easy for everyone to integrate it into their LLM workflows. Additionally, we also provide managed service (with a free trial) where you can run LLM evaluations via an API request or through UpTrain testing console.<p>We would love for you to try it out and give your feedback.<p>Links:\nDemo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.uptrain.ai&#x2F;evals_demo&#x2F;\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.uptrain.ai&#x2F;evals_demo&#x2F;</a>\nGithub repo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;uptrain-ai&#x2F;uptrain\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;uptrain-ai&#x2F;uptrain</a>\nCreate an account (free): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uptrain.ai&#x2F;dashboard\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uptrain.ai&#x2F;dashboard</a>\nUpTrain testing console (need an account): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.uptrain.ai&#x2F;dashboard\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.uptrain.ai&#x2F;dashboard</a>\nWebsite: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uptrain.ai&#x2F;\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uptrain.ai&#x2F;</a>",

With the help of pre-trained language models, it can easily generalize to different kinds of semantic units n-grams or sentences.
