One of its best features is the ability to sync your usage across devices, giving you a complete picture over different time periods. It respects your privacy by only collecting aggregated usage data. No conversation or code details are ever touched.<p>There has been some controversy around tracking usage and whether it might lead to price hikes or limits, but honestly, Anthropic probably already knows this data. The app is more about helping you optimise your workflow, not exposing anything sensitive. It also includes a ranking system so you can get a sense of how others are using Claude Code and maybe learn from their patterns.<p>I built it with a solid backend architecture to be scalable and responsive, running on a small Kubernetes cluster. The goal is to help people like us understand and improve how we work with Claude Code, all wrapped up in a simple web and CLI interface.",

This tag is a tagged version of the `main` branch and does not follow semantic versioning. This model will be included in the next minor release: `v4.57.0`.\r\n\r\n## Embedding-Gemma\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1048\" height=\"548\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f40f9dc-353b-472e-8914-2dbf02709ffb\" />\r\n\r\nToday, Google releases EmbeddingGemma, a state-of-the-art multilingual embedding model perfect for on-device use cases. Designed for speed and efficiency, the model features a compact size of 308M parameters and a 2K context window, unlocking new possibilities for mobile RAG pipelines, agents, and more. EmbeddingGemma is trained to support over 100 languages and is the highest-ranking text-only multilingual embedding model under 500M on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) at the time of writing.\r\n\r\n## Usage example\r\n\r\nEmbeddingGemma can be found on the [Huggingface Hub](https://huggingface.co/models?other=gemma3_text). It is integrated in `sentence-transformers` which depends on `transformers`.\r\n\r\nSee below for `sentence-transformers` examples using the model:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\r\n\r\n# Download from the 🤗 Hub\r\nmodel = SentenceTransformer(\"google/embeddinggemma-300m\")\r\n\r\n# Run inference with queries and documents\r\nquery = \"Which planet is known as the Red Planet?\"\r\ndocuments = [\r\n    \"Venus is often called Earth's twin because of its similar size and proximity.\",\r\n    \"Mars, known for its reddish appearance, is often referred to as the Red Planet.\",\r\n    \"Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, has a prominent red spot.\",\r\n    \"Saturn, famous for its rings, is sometimes mistaken for the Red Planet.\"\r\n]\r\nquery_embeddings = model.encode_query(query)\r\ndocument_embeddings = model.encode_document(documents)\r\nprint(query_embeddings.shape, document_embeddings.shape)\r\n# (768,) (4, 768)\r\n\r\n# Compute similarities to determine a ranking\r\nsimilarities = model.similarity(query_embeddings, document_embeddings)\r\nprint(similarities)\r\n# tensor([[0.3011, 0.6359, 0.4930, 0.4889]])\r\n\r\n# Convert similarities to a ranking\r\nranking = similarities.argsort(descending=True)[0]\r\nprint(ranking)\r\n# tensor([1, 2, 3, 0])\r\n```",

This enables :\r\n\r\n- **Music continuation** : Better modeling of musical semantics yields more coherent continuations.\r\n- **Text-to-Sound Synthesis** : X-Codec captures semantic alignment between text prompts and generated audio.\r\n- **Semantic aware audio tokenization**: X-Codec is used as an audio tokenizer in the YuE lyrics to song generation model.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1958\" height=\"949\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e36552d0-6465-4921-8208-3f7d3c9087f1\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n* Add X-Codec model  by @Manalelaidouni in #38248\r\n\r\n### Ovis 2\r\n\r\nThe [Ovis2](https://github.com/AIDC-AI/Ovis) is an updated version of the [Ovis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20797) model developed by the AIDC-AI team at Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group. \r\n\r\nOvis2 is the latest advancement in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), succeeding Ovis1.6. It retains the architectural design of the Ovis series, which focuses on aligning visual and textual embeddings, and introduces major improvements in data curation and training methods.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/637aebed7ce76c3b834cea37/XB-vgzDL6FshrSNGyZvzc.png\"  width=\"600\">\r\n\r\n* Add Ovis2 model and processor implementation  by @thisisiron in #37088\r\n\r\n### MetaCLIP 2\r\n\r\nMetaCLIP 2 is a replication of the original CLIP model trained on 300+ languages. It achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on multilingual benchmarks (e.g., XM3600, CVQA, Babel‑ImageNet), surpassing previous SOTA such as [mSigLIP](siglip) and [SigLIP‑2](siglip2). The authors show that English and non-English worlds can mutually benefit and elevate each other.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"805\" height=\"408\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72eaa441-9362-4a6a-a834-f505d6727a2a\" />\r\n\r\n* Add MetaCLIP 2  by @NielsRogge in #39826\r\n\r\n### Florence 2\r\n\r\n[Florence-2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06242) is an advanced vision foundation model that uses a prompt-based approach to handle a wide range of vision and vision-language tasks. Florence-2 can interpret simple text prompts to perform tasks like captioning, object detection, and segmentation. It leverages the FLD-5B dataset, containing 5.4 billion annotations across 126 million images, to master multi-task learning. The model's sequence-to-sequence architecture enables it to excel in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, proving to be a competitive vision foundation model.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"864\" height=\"565\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d09dfe3a-6dda-45a3-8dd3-0254d8503b4e\" />\r\n\r\n* Add support for Florence-2  by @ducviet00 in #38188\r\n\r\n### SAM 2\r\n\r\nSAM2 (Segment Anything Model 2) was proposed in [Segment Anything in Images and Videos](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/sam-2-segment-anything-in-images-and-videos/) by Nikhila Ravi, Valentin Gabeur, Yuan-Ting Hu, Ronghang Hu, Chaitanya Ryali, Tengyu Ma, Haitham Khedr, Roman Rädle, Chloe Rolland, Laura Gustafson, Eric Mintun, Junting Pan, Kalyan Vasudev Alwala, Nicolas Carion, Chao-Yuan Wu, Ross Girshick, Piotr Dollár, Christoph Feichtenhofer.\r\n\r\nThe model can be used to predict segmentation masks of any object of interest given an input image or video, and input points or bounding boxes.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"960\" height=\"540\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ab42e5c-6951-4cbc-9d5d-ff8bf0c2dbf1\" />\r\n\r\n* Add Segment Anything 2 (SAM2)  by @SangbumChoi in #32317\r\n\r\n### Kosmos 2.5\r\n\r\nThe Kosmos-2.5 model was proposed in [KOSMOS-2.5: A Multimodal Literate Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11419/) by Microsoft.\r\n\r\nThe abstract from the paper is the following:\r\n\r\n*We present Kosmos-2.5, a multimodal literate model for machine reading of text-intensive images. Pre-trained on large-scale text-intensive images, Kosmos-2.5 excels in two distinct yet cooperative transcription tasks: (1) generating spatially-aware text blocks, where each block of text is assigned its spatial coordinates within the image, and (2) producing structured text output that captures styles and structures into the markdown format. This unified multimodal literate capability is achieved through a shared Transformer architecture, task-specific prompts, and flexible text representations. We evaluate Kosmos-2.5 on end-to-end document-level text recognition and image-to-markdown text generation. Furthermore, the model can be readily adapted for any text-intensive image understanding task with different prompts through supervised fine-tuning, making it a general-purpose tool for real-world applications involving text-rich images. This work also paves the way for the future scaling of multimodal large language models.*\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/transformers/model_doc/kosmos2_5_ocr.png\"\r\nalt=\"drawing\" width=\"600\"/>\r\n\r\n* Add Kosmos-2.5  by @tic-top in #31711\r\n\r\n### HunYuan\r\n\r\n<img width=\"674\" height=\"402\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/230f83f0-870c-4b31-b8b7-738116761457\" />\r\n\r\nMore information at release 🤗\r\n\r\n* HunYuan opensource  by @yjc9696 in #39606\r\n\r\n### Seed OSS\r\n\r\n<img width=\"858\" height=\"537\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29ccc3c2-9b85-4d89-935a-1e1c28d173fd\" />\r\n\r\nMore information at release 🤗\r\n\r\n* Adding ByteDance Seed Seed-OSS  by @Fazziekey in #40272\r\n\r\n### GLM-4.5V\r\n\r\nMore information at release 🤗\r\n\r\n* GLM-4.5V Model Support  by @zRzRzRzRzRzRzR in #39805\r\n\r\n## Cache\r\n\r\nBeyond a large refactor of the caching system in Transformers, making it much more practical and general, models using sliding window attention/chunk attention do not waste memory anymore when caching past states. It was allowed most notable by:\r\n\r\n* New DynamicSlidingWindowLayer & associated Cache by @Cyrilvallez  in #40039\r\n\r\nSee the following improvements on memory usage for Mistral (using only sliding layers) and GPT-OSS (1 out of 2 layers is sliding) respectively:\r\n<img width=\"569\" height=\"431\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f1688f4-b077-4840-a62c-bfa6131fe806\" />\r\n<img width=\"574\" height=\"431\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb4a284f-961e-413d-b7e1-783bb5d8fb39\" />\r\n\r\nBeyond memory usage, it will also improve generation/forward speed by a large margin for large contexts, as only necessary states are passed to the attention computation, which is very sensitive to the sequence length.\r\n\r\n## Quantization\r\n\r\n### MXFP4\r\n\r\nSince the GPT-OSS release which introduced the MXPF4 quantization type, several improvements have been made to the support, which should now stabilize.\r\n\r\n* Fix MXFP4 quantizer validation to allow CPU inference with dequantize option  by @returnL in #39953\r\n* Enable gpt-oss mxfp4 on older hardware (sm75+)  by @matthewdouglas in #39940\r\n* Fix typo and improve GPU kernel check error message in MXFP4 quantization  by @akintunero in #40349) \r\n* Default to dequantize if cpu in device_map for mxfp4  by @MekkCyber in #39993\r\n* Fix GPT-OSS `swiglu_limit` not passed in for MXFP4  by @danielhanchen in #40197\r\n* [`Mxfp4`] Add a way to save with a quantization method  by @ArthurZucker in #40176\r\n\r\n## New standard \r\n\r\nNow that we deprecated tensorflow and jax, we felt that `torch_dtype` was not only misaligned with torch, but was redundant and hard to remember. For this reason, we switched to a much more standard `dtype` argument!\r\n\r\n* ⚠️⚠️ Use dtype instead of torch_dtype everywhere! by @Cyrilvallez in #39782\r\n\r\n`torch_dtype` will still be a valid usage for as long as needed to ensure a smooth transition, but new code should use `dtype`, and we encourage you to update older code as well!\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n\r\nThe following commits are breaking changes in workflows that were either buggy or not working as expected. \r\n\r\n### Saner hub-defaults for hybrid cache implementation\r\n\r\nOn models where the hub checkpoint specifies cache_implementation=\"hybrid\" (static sliding window hybrid cache), UNSETS this value. This will make the model use the dynamic sliding window layers by default.\r\n\r\nThis default meant that there were widespread super slow 1st generate calls on models with hybrid caches, which should nol onger be the case.\r\n\r\n* 🚨🚨  [generate] ignore `cache_implementation=\"hybrid\"` hub defaults  by @gante in #40135\r\n\r\n### Sine positional embeddings for MaskFormer & LRU cache\r\n\r\nCache the computation of sine positional embeddings for MaskFormer; results in a 6% performance improvement.\r\n\r\n* 🚨 Use lru_cache for sine pos embeddings MaskFormer  by @yonigozlan in #40007\r\n\r\n### Explicit cache initialization\r\n\r\nAdds explicit cache initialization to prepare for the deprecation of the `from_legacy_cache` utility.\r\n\r\n* 🚨 Always return Cache objects in modelings (to align with generate)  by @manueldeprada in #39765\r\n\r\n### Default compilation with `fullgraph=False`\r\n\r\nHaving `fullgraph` set to `True` during compilation ended up being very restrictive, especially with the arrival of widely-used MoEs.\r\n\r\n* 🚨🚨 Switch default compilation to fullgraph=False  by @Cyrilvallez in #40137\r\n\r\n### Remove decoding strategies\r\n\r\nThe DoLa decoding strategy has been moved to the following remote-code repository a few versions ago: https://huggingface.co/transformers-community/dola\r\n\r\nThe Contrastive Search decoding strategy has been moved to the following remote-code repository a few versions ago: https://huggingface.co/transformers-community/contrastive-search\r\n\r\nBoth have now been removed from the library as a result.\r\n\r\n* 🚨 Remove DoLa decoding strategy  by @manueldeprada in #40082\r\n* 🚨 Remove Contrastive Search decoding strategy  by @manueldeprada in #40428\r\n\r\n### Fix sliding window in flash attention\r\n\r\nFlash attention has used sliding window sizes which were off by one. This affected generations that had initially bigger contexts than the sliding window size.\r\n\r\n* :rotating_light: [`Flash Attention`] Fix sliding window size  by @vasqu in #40163\r\n\r\n### Minimum Torch version is now 2.2\r\n\r\nTorch 2.1 support has been unreliable for some time, so we've now made it official and bumped our minimum version to 2.2.\r\n\r\n* byebye torch 2.1 by @Rocketknight1 in

      "content": "Hi, We’ve built Pantheon-CLI, an fully open-source project that aims to be the “Python Claude Code + Notebook” — but designed for data analysis instead of just coding.<p>Unlike most AI coding assistants, Pantheon-CLI runs entirely on your machine (or server). No data upload required. It blends natural language and code in a single workflow, keeping variables in memory and letting you switch seamlessly between typing code and asking in plain English.<p>What it does:\n1. Chat with your data: Directly process CSV, Excel, AnnData, Pickle, Torch tensors, or any format supported by Python&#x2F;R&#x2F;Julia.\n2. Mixed programming: Variables persist across natural language and code; the CLI auto-generates and runs code for you.\n3. MCP-like agent integration: Read&#x2F;create files, run commands, fetch web pages, generate&#x2F;revise code.\n4. Human-like learning: Feed it a PDF paper or tutorial—Pantheon-CLI reads it, plans steps, and replicates methods before analysis.\n5. Task planning: Builds scientific agents by learning from papers&#x2F;tutorials (not just fixed, human-predefined steps).\n6. Multi-model support: Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, DeepSeek, Qwen, etc. + offline local LLMs (ollama, deepseek, gpt-oss).\n7. Multi-RAG support: Pre-learns from docs&#x2F;web into a local “brain” for more credible outputs without massive token costs.\n8. Built-in biology toolsets: For omics analysis (alignment, annotation, differential expression, full paper reproduction).\n9. Notebook mode: Brings the same agentic workflow into Jupyter—automatically runs and revises code, operates on files, and learns from tutorials&#x2F;papers.<p>Pantheon-CLI is our attempt to push beyond “AI writes code for you.” Instead, it’s an agentic operating system for data analysis, spanning both terminal and notebook.<p>Repo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aristoteleo&#x2F;pantheon-cli\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aristoteleo&#x2F;pantheon-cli</a><p>Tutorial: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pantheonos.stanford.edu&#x2F;cli&#x2F;docs&#x2F;intro&#x2F;getting-started\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pantheonos.stanford.edu&#x2F;cli&#x2F;docs&#x2F;intro&#x2F;getting-start...</a><p>Home page: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pantheonos.stanford.edu&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pantheonos.stanford.edu&#x2F;</a><p>Would love to hear feedback from the HN community—what use cases would you try this for, and what features would make it more useful to you?",
