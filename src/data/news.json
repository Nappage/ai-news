This is the first major release in five years, and the release is significant: 1200 commits have been pushed to `main` since the latest minor release. This release removes a lot of long-due deprecations, introduces several refactors that significantly simplify our APIs and internals, and comes with a large number of bug fixes.\r\n\r\nWe give an overview of our focus for this release in the [following blogpost](https://huggingface.co/blog/transformers-v5). In these release notes, we'll focus directly on the refactors and new APIs coming with v5.\r\n\r\nThis release is the full V5 release. **It sets in motion something bigger: going forward, starting with v5, we'll now release minor releases every week, rather than every 5 weeks. Expect v5.1 to follow next week, then v5.2 the week that follows, etc.**\r\n\r\nWe're moving forward with this change to ensure you have access to models as soon as they're supported in the library, rather than a few weeks after.\r\n\r\nIn order to install this release, please do so with the following:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\npip install transformers\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor us to deliver the best package possible, it is imperative that we have feedback on how the toolkit is currently working for you. Please try it out, and [open an issue](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/) in case you're facing something inconsistent/a bug.\r\n\r\nTransformers version 5 is a community endeavor, and we couldn't have shipped such a massive release without the help of the entire community.\r\n\r\n## Significant API changes\r\n\r\n### Dynamic weight loading\r\n\r\nWe introduce a new weight loading API in `transformers`, which significantly improves on the previous API. This\r\nweight loading API is designed to apply operations to the checkpoints loaded by transformers.\r\n\r\nInstead of loading the checkpoint exactly as it is serialized within the model, these operations can reshape, merge,\r\nand split the layers according to how they're defined in this new API. These operations are often a necessity when\r\nworking with quantization or parallelism algorithms.\r\n\r\nThis new API is centered around the new `WeightConverter` class:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass WeightConverter(WeightTransform):\r\n    operations: list[ConversionOps]\r\n    source_keys: Union[str, list[str]]\r\n    target_keys: Union[str, list[str]]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe weight converter is designed to apply a list of operations on the source keys, resulting in target keys. A common\r\noperation done on the attention layers is to fuse the query, key, values layers. Doing so with this API would amount\r\nto defining the following conversion:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nconversion = WeightConverter(\r\n    [\"self_attn.q_proj\", \"self_attn.k_proj\", \"self_attn.v_proj\"],  # The input layers\r\n    \"self_attn.qkv_proj\",  # The single layer as output\r\n    operations=[Concatenate(dim=0)],\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this situation, we apply the `Concatenate` operation, which accepts a list of layers as input and returns a single \r\nlayer. \r\n\r\nThis allows us to define a mapping from architecture to a list of weight conversions. Applying those weight conversions\r\ncan apply arbitrary transformations to the layers themselves. This significantly simplified the `from_pretrained` method\r\nand helped us remove a lot of technical debt that we accumulated over the past few years.\r\n\r\nThis results in several improvements:\r\n- Much cleaner definition of transformations applied to the checkpoint\r\n- Reversible transformations, so loading and saving a checkpoint should result in the same checkpoint\r\n- Faster model loading thanks to scheduling of tensor materialization\r\n- Enables complex mix of transformations that wouldn't otherwise be possible (such as quantization + MoEs, or TP + MoEs)\r\n\r\nLinked PR: https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/41580\r\n\r\n### Tokenization\r\n\r\nJust as we moved towards a single backend library for model definition, we want our tokenizers, and the `Tokenizer` object to be a lot more intuitive. With v5, tokenizer definition is much simpler; one can now initialize an empty `LlamaTokenizer` and train it directly on your corpus.\r\n\r\nDefining a new tokenizer object should be as simple as this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom transformers import TokenizersBackend, generate_merges\r\nfrom tokenizers import pre_tokenizers, Tokenizer\r\nfrom tokenizers.model import BPE\r\n\r\nclass Llama5Tokenizer(TokenizersBackend):\r\n    def __init__(self, unk_token=\"<unk>\",bos_token=\"<s>\", eos_token=\"</s>\", vocab=None, merges=None ):\r\n        if vocab is None:\r\n            self._vocab = {\r\n                str(unk_token): 0,\r\n                str(bos_token): 1,\r\n                str(eos_token): 2,\r\n            }\r\n\r\n        else:\r\n            self._vocab = vocab\r\n\r\n            self._merges = merges\r\n\r\n        self._tokenizer = Tokenizer(\r\n            BPE(vocab=self._vocab, merges=self._merges, fuse_unk=True)\r\n        )\r\n        self._tokenizer.pre_tokenizer = pre_tokenizers.Metaspace(\r\n            replacement=\"▁\", prepend_scheme=_get_prepend_scheme(self.add_prefix_space, self), split=False\r\n        )\r\n        super().__init__(\r\n            tokenizer_object=self._tokenizer,\r\n            unk_token=unk_token,\r\n            bos_token=bos_token,\r\n            eos_token=eos_token,\r\n        )\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce the tokenizer is defined as above, you can load it with the following: `Llama5Tokenizer()`. Doing this returns you an empty, trainable tokenizer that follows the definition of the authors of `Llama5` (it does not exist yet :wink:).\r\n\r\nThe above is the main motivation towards refactoring tokenization: we want tokenizers to behave similarly to models: trained or empty, and with exactly what is defined in their class definition.\r\n\r\n### Backend Architecture Changes: moving away from the slow/fast tokenizer separation\r\n\r\nUp to now, transformers maintained two parallel implementations for many tokenizers:\r\n- \"Slow\" tokenizers (`tokenization_<model>.py`) - Python-based implementations, often using [SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece) as the backend.\r\n- \"Fast\" tokenizers (`tokenization_<model>_fast.py`) - Rust-based implementations using the 🤗 [tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers) library.\r\n\r\nIn v5, we consolidate to a single tokenizer file per model: `tokenization_<model>.py`. This file will use the most appropriate backend available:\r\n\r\n1. **TokenizersBackend** (preferred): Rust-based tokenizers from the 🤗 [tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers) library. In general it provides optimal performance, but it also offers a lot more features that are commonly adopted across the ecosystem:\r\n  - handling additional tokens\r\n  - a full python API for setting and updating \r\n  - automatic parallelization,\r\n  - automatic offsets\r\n  - customization\r\n  - training\r\n2. **SentencePieceBackend**: for tokenizers requiring the `sentencepiece` library. It inherits from `PythonBackend`. \r\n3. **PythonBackend**: a Python implementations of the features provided by `tokenizers`. Basically allows adding tokens.\r\n4. **MistralCommonBackend**: relies on `MistralCommon`'s tokenization library. (Previously known as the `MistralCommonTokenizer`)\r\n\r\nThe `AutoTokenizer` automatically selects the appropriate backend based on available files and dependencies. This is transparent, you continue to use `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained()` as before. This allows transformers to be future-proof and modular to easily support future backends.\r\n\r\n### Defining a tokenizers outside of the existing backends\r\n\r\nWe enable users and tokenizer builders to define their own tokenizers from top to bottom. Tokenizers are usually defined using a backend such as `tokenizers`, `sentencepiece` or `mistral-common`, but we offer the possibility to design the tokenizer at a higher-level, without relying on those backends.\r\n\r\nTo do so, you can import the `PythonBackend` (which was previously known as `PreTrainedTokenizer`). This class encapsulates all the logic related to added tokens, encoding, and decoding.\r\n\r\nIf you want something even higher up the stack, then `PreTrainedTokenizerBase` is what `PythonBackend` inherits from. It contains the very basic tokenizer API features: \r\n- `encode`\r\n- `decode`\r\n- `vocab_size`\r\n- `get_vocab`\r\n- `convert_tokens_to_ids`\r\n- `convert_ids_to_tokens`\r\n- `from_pretrained`\r\n- `save_pretrained`\r\n- among a few others\r\n\r\n### API Changes\r\n\r\n#### 1. Direct tokenizer initialization with vocab and merges\r\n\r\nStarting with v5, we now enable initializing blank, untrained `tokenizers`-backed tokenizers:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom transformers import LlamaTokenizer\r\n\r\ntokenizer = LlamaTokenizer()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis tokenizer will therefore follow the definition of the `LlamaTokenizer` as defined in its class definition. It can then be trained on a corpus as can be seen in [the `tokenizers` documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/tokenizers/training_from_memory).\r\n\r\nThese tokenizers can also be initialized from vocab and merges (if necessary), like the previous \"slow\" tokenizers:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom transformers import LlamaTokenizer\r\n\r\nvocab = {\"<unk>\": 0, \"<s>\": 1, \"</s>\": 2, \"hello\": 3, \"world\": 4}\r\nmerges = [(\"h\", \"e\"), (\"l\", \"l\"), (\"o\", \" \")]\r\n\r\ntokenizer = LlamaTokenizer(vocab=vocab, merges=merges)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis tokenizer will behave as a Llama-like tokenizer, with an updated vocabulary. This allows comparing different tokenizer classes with the same vocab; therefore enabling the comparison of different pre-tokenizers, normalizers, etc.\r\n\r\n⚠️ The `vocab_file` (as in, a path towards a file containing the vocabulary) cannot be used to initialize the `LlamaTokenizer` as loading from files is reserved to the `from_pretrained` method.\r\n\r\n#### 2. Simplified decoding API\r\n\r\nThe `batch_decode` and `decode` methods have been unified to reflect behavior of the `encode` method. Both single and batch decoding now use the same `decode` method. See an example of the new behavior below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer\r\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"t5-small\") \r\ninputs = [\"hey how are you?\", \"fine\"]\r\ntokenizer.decode(tokenizer.encode(inputs))\r\n```\r\n\r\nGives:\r\n```diff\r\n- 'hey how are you?</s> fine</s>'\r\n+ ['hey how are you?</s>', 'fine</s>']\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe expect `encode` and `decode` to behave, as two sides of the same coin: `encode`, `process`, `decode`,  should work. \r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> A common use-case would be: `encode`, `model.generate`, `decode`.  However, using `generate` would return `list[list[int]]`, which would then be incompatible with `decode`.\r\n\r\n#### 3. Unified encoding API\r\n\r\nThe `encode_plus` method is deprecated in favor of the single `__call__` method.\r\n\r\n#### 4. `apply_chat_template` returns `BatchEncoding`\r\n\r\nPreviously, `apply_chat_template` returned `input_ids` for backward compatibility. Starting with v5, it now consistently returns a `BatchEncoding` dict like other tokenizer methods.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# v5\r\nmessages = [\r\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello!\"},\r\n    {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Hi there!\"}\r\n]\r\n\r\n# Now returns BatchEncoding with input_ids, attention_mask, etc.\r\noutputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, return_tensors=\"pt\")\r\nprint(outputs.keys())  # dict_keys(['input_ids', 'attention_mask'])\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 5. Removed legacy configuration file saving:\r\n\r\nWe simplify the serialization of tokenization attributes:\r\n\r\n- `special_tokens_map.json` - special tokens are now stored in `tokenizer_config.json`.\r\n- `added_tokens.json` - added tokens are now stored in `tokenizer.json`.\r\n- `added_tokens_decoder` is only stored when there is no `tokenizer.json`.\r\n\r\nWhen loading older tokenizers, these files are still read for backward compatibility, but new saves use the consolidated format. We're gradually moving towards consolidating attributes to fewer files so that other libraries and implementations may depend on them more reliably.\r\n\r\n#### 6. Model-Specific Changes\r\n\r\nSeveral models that had identical tokenizers now import from their base implementation:\r\n\r\n- **LayoutLM** → uses BertTokenizer\r\n- **LED** → uses BartTokenizer  \r\n- **Longformer** → uses RobertaTokenizer\r\n- **LXMert** → uses BertTokenizer\r\n- **MT5** → uses T5Tokenizer\r\n- **MVP** → uses BartTokenizer\r\n\r\nThese modules will eventually be removed altogether.\r\n\r\n**Removed T5-specific workarounds**\r\n\r\nThe internal `_eventually_correct_t5_max_length` method has been removed. T5 tokenizers now handle max length consistently with other models.\r\n\r\n### Testing Changes\r\n\r\nA few testing changes specific to tokenizers have been applied:\r\n- Model-specific tokenization test files now focus on integration tests.\r\n- Common tokenization API tests (e.g., `add_tokens`, `encode`, `decode`) are now centralized and automatically applied across all tokenizers. This reduces test duplication and ensures consistent behavior\r\n\r\nFor legacy implementations, the original BERT Python tokenizer code (including `WhitespaceTokenizer`, `BasicTokenizer`, etc.) is preserved in `bert_legacy.py` for reference purposes.\r\n\r\n#### 7. Deprecated / Modified Features\r\n\r\n**Special Tokens Structure:**\r\n- `SpecialTokensMixin`: Merged into `PreTrainedTokenizerBase` to simplify the tokenizer architecture.\r\n- `special_tokens_map`: Now only stores named special token attributes (e.g., `bos_token`, `eos_token`). Use `extra_special_tokens` for additional special tokens (formerly `additional_special_tokens`). `all_special_tokens` includes both named and extra tokens.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# v4\r\ntokenizer.special_tokens_map  # Included 'additional_special_tokens'\r\n\r\n# v5\r\ntokenizer.special_tokens_map  # Only named tokens\r\ntokenizer.extra_special_tokens  # Additional tokens\r\n```\r\n\r\n- `special_tokens_map_extended` and `all_special_tokens_extended`: Removed. Access `AddedToken` objects directly from `_special_tokens_map` or `_extra_special_tokens` if needed.\r\n- `additional_special_tokens`: Still accepted for backward compatibility but is automatically converted to `extra_special_tokens`.\r\n\r\n**Deprecated Methods:**\r\n- `sanitize_special_tokens()`: Already deprecated in v4, removed in v5.\r\n- `prepare_seq2seq_batch()`: Deprecated; use `__call__()` with `text_target` parameter instead.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# v4\r\nmodel_inputs = tokenizer.prepare_seq2seq_batch(src_texts, tgt_texts, max_length=128)\r\n\r\n# v5\r\nmodel_inputs = tokenizer(src_texts, text_target=tgt_texts, max_length=128, return_tensors=\"pt\")\r\nmodel_inputs[\"labels\"] = model_inputs.pop(\"input_ids_target\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n- `BatchEncoding.words()`: Deprecated; use `word_ids()` instead.\r\n\r\n**Removed Methods:**\r\n- `create_token_type_ids_from_sequences()`: Removed from base class. Subclasses that need custom token type ID creation should implement this method directly.\r\n- `prepare_for_model()`, `build_inputs_with_special_tokens()`, `truncate_sequences()`: Moved from `tokenization_utils_base.py` to `tokenization_python.py` for `PythonBackend` tokenizers. `TokenizersBackend` provides model-ready input via `tokenize()` and `encode()`, so these methods are no longer needed in the base class.\r\n- `_switch_to_input_mode()`, `_switch_to_target_mode()`, `as_target_tokenizer()`: Removed from base class. Use `__call__()` with `text_target` parameter instead.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# v4\r\nwith tokenizer.as_target_tokenizer():\r\n    labels = tokenizer(tgt_texts, ...)\r\n\r\n# v5\r\nlabels = tokenizer(text_target=tgt_texts, ...)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- `parse_response()`: Removed from base class.\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\n#### MoE Performance\r\n\r\nThe v5 release significantly improves the performance of the MoE models, as can be seen in the graphs below. We improve and optimize MoE performance through batched and grouped experts implementations, and we optimize them for decoding using `batched_mm`.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"2048\" height=\"1451\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3f2e59f-3026-4f56-9a56-36e4eb0fcf73\" />\r\n\r\n#### Core performance\r\n\r\nWe focus on improving the performance of loading weights on device (which gives speedups up to 6x in tensor parallel situations); this is preliminary work that we'll continue to work on in the coming weeks. Some notable improvements:\r\n\r\n- [saving] Simplify general logic by @Cyrilvallez in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/42766\r\n- Do not rely on config for inferring model dtype by @Cyrilvallez in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/42838\r\n- Improve BatchFeature: stack list and lists of torch tensors by @yonigozlan in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/42750\r\n- Remove tied weights from internal attribute if they are not tied by @Cyrilvallez in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/42871\r\n- Enforce call to post_init and fix all of them by @Cyrilvallez in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/42873\r\n- Simplify tie weights logic by @Cyrilvallez in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/42895\r\n- Add buffers to _init_weights for ALL models by @Cyrilvallez in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/42309\r\n- [loading] Really initialize on meta device for huge perf gains by @Cyrilvallez in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/42941\r\n- Do not use accelerate hooks if the device_map has only 1 device by @Cyrilvallez in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/43019\r\n- Move missing weights and non-persistent buffers to correct device earlier by @Cyrilvallez in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/43021\r\n\r\n## Library-wide changes with lesser impact\r\n\r\n### Default `dtype` update\r\n\r\nWe have updated the default `dtype` for all models loaded with `from_pretrained` to be `auto`. This will lead to model instantiations respecting the `dtype` in which the model was saved, rather than forcing it to load in float 32.\r\n\r\nYou can, of course, still specify the `dtype` in which you want to load your model by specifying it as an argument to the `from_pretrained` method.\r\n\r\n### Shard size\r\n\r\nThe Hugging Face Hub infrastructure has gradually moved to a XET backend. This will significantly simplify uploads and downloads, with higher download and upload speeds, partial uploads, and, most notably, a higher threshold for accepted file sizes on the Hugging Face Hub.\r\n\r\nTo reflect this, we're increasing the default shard size of models serialized on the Hub to 50GB (up from 5GB).\r\n\r\n### `use_auth_token`\r\n\r\nThe `use_auth_token` argument/parameter is deprecated in favor of `token` everywhere.\r\nYou should be able to search and replace `use_auth_token` with `token` and get the same logic.\r\n\r\nLinked PR: https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/41666\r\n\r\n### Attention-related features\r\n\r\nWe decided to remove some features for the upcoming v5 as they are currently only supported in a few old models and no longer integrated in current model additions. It's recommended to stick to v4.x in case you need them. Following features are affected:\r\n- No more head masking, see [#41076](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/41076). This feature allowed to turn off certain heads during the attention calculation and only worked for eager.\r\n- No more relative positional biases in Bert-like models, see [#41170](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/41170). This feature was introduced to allow relative position scores within attention calculations (similar to T5). However, this feature is barely used in official models and a lot of complexity instead. It also only worked with eager.\r\n- No more head pruning, see [#41417](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/41417) by @gante. As the name suggests, it allowed to prune heads within your attention layers.\r\n\r\n### Updates to supported torch APIs\r\n\r\nWe dropped support for two torch APIs:\r\n- `torchscript` in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/41688\r\n- `torch.fx` in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/41683\r\n\r\nThose APIs were deprecated by the PyTorch team, and we're instead focusing on the supported APIs `dynamo` and `export`.\r\n\r\n## Quantization changes\r\n\r\nWe clean up the quantization API in transformers, and significantly refactor the weight loading as highlighted\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nWe drop support for two quantization arguments that have been deprecated for some time:\r\n- `load_in_4bit`\r\n- `load_in_8bit`\r\n\r\nWe remove them in favor of the `quantization_config` argument which is much more complete. As an example, here is how\r\nyou would load a 4-bit bitsandbytes model using this argument:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, BitsAndBytesConfig\r\n\r\nquantization_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(load_in_4bit=True)\r\n\r\nmodel_4bit = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\r\n    \"meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B\",\r\n    device_map=\"auto\",\r\n    quantization_config=quantization_config\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\n- Methods to init a nested config such as `from_xxx_config` are deleted. Configs can be init from the `__init__` method in the same way. See [#41314](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/41314).\r\n- It is no longer possible to load a config class from a URL file. Configs must be loaded from either a local path or a repo on the Hub. See [#42383](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/42383).\r\n- All parameters for configuring model's rotary embedding are now stored under `mode.rope_parameters`, including the `rope_theta` and `rope_type`. Model's `config.rope_parameters` is a simple dictionaty in most cases, and can also be a nested dict in special cases (i.e. Gemma3 and ModernBert) with different rope parameterization for each layer type. Trying to get `config.rope_theta` will throw an attribute error from now on. See [#39847](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/39847) and [#42255](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/42255)\r\n- Qwen-VL family configuration is in a nested format and trying to access keys directly will throw an error (e.g. `config.vocab_size`). Users are expected to access keys from their respective sub-configs (`config.text_config.vocab_size`).\r\n- Configurations of non-generative models (any model that doesn't call `model.generate()`) will no longer have a `generation_config` and `model.config.generation_config` will throw an attribute error.\r\n\r\n## Processing\r\n\r\n### Tokenization\r\n\r\n- Slow tokenizer files (aka: `tokenization_<model>.py` ) will be removed in favor of using fast tokenizer files `tokenization_<model>_fast.py` --> will be renamed to `tokenization_<model>.py`.  As fast tokenizers are :hugs:`tokenizers` - backend, they include a wider range of features that are maintainable and reliable. \r\n- Other backends (sentence piece, tokenizers, etc.) will be supported with a light layer if loading a fast tokenizer fails\r\n- Remove legacy files like special_tokens_map.json and added_tokens.json\r\n- Remove _eventually_correct_t5_max_length \r\n- `encode_plus` --> `__call__`\r\n- `batch_decode` --> `decode`\r\n\r\n`apply_chat_template` by default returns naked `input_ids` rather than a `BatchEncoding` dict. \r\nThis was inconvenient - it should return a `BatchEncoding` dict like `tokenizer.__call__()`, but we were stuck with \r\nit for backward compatibility. The method now returns a `BatchEncoding`.\r\n\r\nLinked PRs: \r\n- https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/40938\r\n- https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/40936\r\n- https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/41626\r\n\r\n### Processing classes\r\n\r\n- In processing classes each attribute will be serialized under `processor_config.json` as a nested dict, instead of serializing attributes in their own config files. Loading will be supported for all old format processors (https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/41474)\r\n- `XXXFeatureExtractors` classes are completely removed in favor of `XXXImageProcessor` class for all vision models (https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/41174)\r\n- Minor change: `XXXFastImageProcessorKwargs` is removed in favor of `XXXImageProcessorKwargs` which will be shared between fast and slow processors (https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/40931)\r\n\r\n## Modeling\r\n\r\n- Some `RotaryEmbeddings` layers will start returning a dict of tuples, in case the model uses several RoPE configurations (Gemma2, ModernBert). Each value will be a tuple of \"cos, sin\" per RoPE type.\r\n- Config attribute for `RotaryEmbeddings` layer will be unified and accessed via `config.rope_parameters`. Config attr for `rope_theta` might not be accessible anymore for some models, and instead will be in `config.rope_parameters['rope_theta']`. BC will be supported for a while as much as possible, and in the near future we'll gradually move to the new RoPE format  (https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/39847)\r\n- Vision Language models will not have a shortcut access to its language and vision component from the generative model via `model.language_model`. It is recommended to either access the module with `model.model.language_model` or `model.get_decoder()`. See [#42156](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/42156/)\r\n- All models now accept `kwargs` in their forward methods\r\n\r\n### Generate\r\n\r\n- Old, deprecated output type aliases were removed (e.g. `GreedySearchEncoderDecoderOutput`). We now only have 4 output classes built from the following matrix: decoder-only vs encoder-decoder, uses beams vs doesn't use beams (https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/40998)\r\n- Removed deprecated classes regarding decoding methods that were moved to the Hub due to low usage (constraints and beam scores) (https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/41223)\r\n- If `generate` doesn't receive any KV Cache argument, the default cache class used is now defined by the model (as opposed to always being `DynamicCache`) (https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/41505)\r\n- Generation parameters are no longer accessible via model's config. If generation paramaters are serialized in `config.json` for any old model, it will be loaded back into model's generation config. Users are expected to access or modify generation parameters only with `model.generation_config.do_sample = True`. \r\n\r\n## Trainer\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n\r\n* **ALST/Ulysses Sequence Parallelism Integration**\r\n  - Added sequence parallelism support via HF Accelerate for training with longer sequences. Enables splitting sequences across devices using ALST (All-to-All Long Sequence Training) and Ulysses algorithms with DeepSpeed.\r\n* **Improved `compute_loss_func` Handling**\r\n  - `compute_loss_func` now always takes priority over the model's built-in loss computation, giving users consistent control over custom loss functions.\r\n* **`num_items_in_batch` in Prediction Step**\r\n  - The `num_items_in_batch` argument is now passed to `compute_loss` during `prediction_step`, enabling proper loss scaling during evaluation.\r\n\r\n### Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n* **`report_to` now defaults to `\"none\"`**\r\n  - Logging integrations are no longer auto-detected by default; users must explicitly specify which reporting backends to use.\r\n\r\n### Removing arguments without deprecation cycle in `TrainingArguments` due to low usage\r\n\r\n- `mp_parameters` -> legacy param that was later on added to the Sagemaker trainer\r\n- `_n_gpu` -> not intended for users to set, we will initialize it correctly instead of putting it in the `TrainingArguments`\r\n- `overwrite_output_dir` - > replaced by `resume_from_checkpoint`, and it was only used in the examples script, no impact on Trainer. \r\n- `logging_dir` -> only used for tensorboard, set `TENSORBOARD_LOGGING_DIR` env var instead\r\n- `jit_mode_eval` -> use `use_torch_compile` instead, as torchscript is not recommended anymore\r\n- `tpu_num_cores`-> It is actually better to remove it, as it is not recommended to set the number of cores. By default, all TPU cores are used . Set `TPU_NUM_CORES` env var instead\r\n- `past_index` -> it was only used for a very small number of models that have special architecture like transformersxl + it was not documented at all how to train those models\r\n- `ray_scope` -> only for a minor arg for ray integration. Set `RAY_SCOPE` var env instead \r\n- `warmup_ratio` -> use `warmup_step` instead. We combined both args together by allowing passing float values in `warmup_step`. \r\n\r\n### Removing deprecated arguments in `TrainingArguments`\r\n\r\n- `fsdp_min_num_params` and `fsdp_transformer_layer_cls_to_wrap` -> use `fsdp_config`\r\n- `tpu_metrics_debug` -> `debug` \r\n- `push_to_hub_token` -> `hub_token`\r\n- `push_to_hub_model_id` and `push_to_hub_organization` -> `hub_model_id`\r\n- `include_inputs_for_metrics` -> `include_for_metrics`\r\n- `per_gpu_train_batch_size` -> `per_device_train_batch_size`\r\n- `per_gpu_eval_batch_size` -> `per_device_eval_batch_size`\r\n- `use_mps_device` -> mps will be used by default if detected\r\n- `fp16_backend` and `half_precision_backend` -> we will only rely on `torch.amp` as everything has been upstreamed to torch\r\n- `no_cuda` -> `use_cpu`\r\n- ` include_tokens_per_second` -> `include_num_input_tokens_seen`\r\n- `use_legacy_prediction_loop` -> we only use `evaluation_loop` function from now on\r\n\r\n### Removing deprecated arguments in `Trainer`\r\n\r\n- `tokenizer` in initialization -> `processing_class`\r\n- `model_path` in train() -> `resume_from_checkpoint`\r\n\r\n### Removed features for `Trainer`\r\n\r\n- sigpot integration for hp search was removed as the library was archived + the api stopped working\r\n- drop support for sagemaker API <1.10\r\n- bump accelerate minimum version to 1.1.0 \r\n- bump peft minimum version to 0.18.0\r\n- bump bitsandbytes minimum version to 0.46.1\r\n\r\n###  New defaults for `Trainer`\r\n\r\n- `use_cache` in the model config will be set to `False`. You can still change the cache value through `TrainingArguments` `usel_cache` argument if needed. \r\n\r\n## Pipeline\r\n\r\n- Image text to text pipelines will no longer accept images as a separate argument along with conversation chats. Image data has to be embedded in the chat's \"content\" field. See [#42359](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/42359)\r\n\r\n## PushToHubMixin\r\n\r\n- removed deprecated `organization` and `repo_url` from `PushToHubMixin`. You must pass a `repo_id` instead.\r\n- removed `ignore_metadata_errors` from `PushToMixin`. In practice if we ignore errors while loading the model card, we won't be able to push the card back to the Hub so it's better to fail early and not provide the option to fail later.\r\n- `push_to_hub` do not accept `**kwargs` anymore. All accepted parameters are explicitly documented.\r\n- arguments of `push_to_hub` are now keyword-only to avoid confusion. Only `repo_id` can be positional since it's the main arg.\r\n- removed `use_temp_dir` argument from `push_to_hub`. We now use a tmp dir in all cases.\r\n\r\nLinked PR: https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/42391.\r\n\r\n## CLI\r\n\r\nThe deprecated `transformers-cli ...` command was deprecated, `transformers ...` is now the only CLI entry point.\r\n\r\n`transformers` CLI has been migrated to `Typer`, making it easier to maintain + adding some nice features out of \r\nthe box (improved `--help` section, autocompletion).\r\n\r\nBiggest breaking change is in `transformers chat`. This command starts a terminal UI to interact with a chat model. \r\nIt used to also be able to start a Chat Completion server powered by `transformers` and chat with it. In this revamped \r\nversion, this feature has been removed in favor of `transformers serve`. The goal of splitting `transformers chat` \r\nand `transformers serve` is to define clear boundaries between client and server code. It helps with maintenance \r\nbut also makes the commands less bloated. The new signature of `transformers chat` is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUsage: transformers chat [OPTIONS] BASE_URL MODEL_ID [GENERATE_FLAGS]...\r\n\r\nChat with a model from the command line.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt works hand in hand with `transformers serve`, which means that if `transformers serve` is running on its default endpoint, `transformers chat` can be launched as follows:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ntransformers chat HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM3-3B\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt can however use any OpenAI API compatible HTTP endpoint:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ntransformers chat HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM3-3B https://router.huggingface.co/v1\r\n```\r\n\r\nLinked PRs: \r\n- https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/40997\r\n- https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/41487\r\n\r\n### Removal of the `run` method\r\n\r\nThe `transformers run` (previously `transformers-cli run`) is an artefact of the past, was not documented nor tested,\r\nand isn't part of any public documentation. We're removing it for now and ask you to please let us know in case\r\nthis is a method you are using; in which case we should bring it back with better support.\r\n\r\nLinked PR: https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/42447\r\n\r\n## Environment variables\r\n\r\n- Legacy environment variables like `TRANSFORMERS_CACHE`, `PYTORCH_TRANSFORMERS_CACHE`, and `PYTORCH_PRETRAINED_BERT_CACHE` have been removed. Please use `HF_HOME` instead.\r\n- Constants `HUGGINGFACE_CO_EXAMPLES_TELEMETRY`, `HUGGINGFACE_CO_EXAMPLES_TELEMETRY`, `HUGGINGFACE_CO_PREFIX`, and `HUGGINGFACE_CO_RESOLVE_ENDPOINT` have been removed. Please use `huggingface_hub.constants.ENDPOINT` instead.\r\n\r\nLinked PR: https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/42391.\r\n\r\n## Requirements update\r\n\r\n`transformers` v5 pins the `huggingface_hub` version to `>=1.0.0`. See this [migration guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/concepts/migration) to learn more about this major release. Here are to main aspects to know about:\r\n- switched the HTTP backend from `requests` to `httpx`. This change was made to improve performance and to support both synchronous and asynchronous requests the same way. If you are currently catching `requests.HTTPError` errors in your codebase, you'll need to switch to `httpx.HTTPError`.\r\n- related to 1., it is not possible to set proxies from your script. To handle proxies, you must set the `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables\r\n- `hf_transfer` and therefore `HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER` have been completed dropped in favor of `hf_xet`. This should be transparent for most users. Please let us know if you notice any downside!\r\n\r\n`typer-slim` has been added as required dependency, used to implement both `hf` and `transformers` CLIs.\r\n\r\n## New model additions in v5\r\n\r\n### CWM\r\n\r\n<img width=\"809\" height=\"471\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58bb9c70-d481-48ed-ab8f-6553be7c240f\" />\r\n\r\nThe Code World Model (CWM) model was proposed in [CWM: An Open-Weights LLM for Research on Code Generation with World Models](https://ai.facebook.com/research/publications/cwm) by Meta FAIR CodeGen Team. CWM is an LLM for code generation and reasoning about code that has, in particular, been trained to better represent and reason about how code and commands affect the state of a program or system. Specifically, we mid-trained CWM on a large number of observation-action trajectories from Python execution traces and agentic interactions in containerized environments. We post-trained with extensive multi-task RL in verifiable coding, math, and multi-turn software engineering environments.\r\n\r\n* Add Code World Model (CWM)  by @jacobkahn in #41199\r\n\r\n### SAM3\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1505\" height=\"915\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eec48633-f02b-464a-ae5c-c65473387e53\" />\r\n\r\nSAM3 (Segment Anything Model 3) was introduced in [SAM 3: Segment Anything with Concepts](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/sam-3-segment-anything-with-concepts/).\r\n\r\nThe SAM3 addition adds four new architectures:\r\n- Sam3\r\n- Sam3Tracker\r\n- Sam3TrackerVideo\r\n- Sam3Video\r\n\r\nSAM3 performs Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS) on images. PCS takes text and/or image exemplars as input (e.g., \"yellow school bus\"), and predicts instance and semantic masks for every single object matching the concept.\r\n\r\nSam3Tracker and Sam3TrackerVideo perform Promptable Visual Segmentation (PVS) on images. PVS takes interactive visual prompts (points, boxes, masks) or text inputs to segment a specific object instance per prompt. This is the task that SAM 1 and SAM 2 focused on, and SAM 3 improves upon it. Sam3Tracker and Sam3TrackerVideo are updated versions of SAM2 Video that maintain the same API while providing improved performance and capabilities.\r\n\r\nSAM3 Video performs Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS) on videos. PCS takes text as input (e.g., \"yellow school bus\"), and predicts instance and semantic masks for every single object matching the concept, while preserving object identities across video frames. The model combines a detection module (SAM3) with a tracking module (SAM2-style tracker) to enable robust object tracking across video frames using text prompts.\r\n\r\n* Add SAM3 to 🤗 Transformers  by @yonigozlan in #42285\r\n\r\n### LFM2 MoE\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1080\" height=\"849\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9fa1b81-114d-4054-9699-5083ac69d830\" />\r\n\r\nLFM2-MoE is a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) variant of [LFM2](https://huggingface.co/collections/LiquidAI/lfm2-686d721927015b2ad73eaa38). The LFM2 family is optimized for on-device inference by combining short‑range, input‑aware gated convolutions with grouped‑query attention (GQA) in a layout tuned to maximize quality under strict speed and memory constraints.\r\n\r\nLFM2‑MoE keeps this fast backbone and introduces sparse MoE feed‑forward networks to add representational capacity without significantly increasing the active compute path. The first LFM2-MoE release is LFM2-8B-A1B, with 8.3B total parameters and 1.5B active parameters. The model excels in quality (comparable to 3-4B dense models) and speed (faster than other 1.5B class models).\r\n\r\n* [Model] Lfm2Moe  by @paulpak58 in #41401\r\n\r\n### VideoLlama 3\r\n\r\n<img width=\"812\" height=\"366\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21c82c6e-cf0a-4d6c-a707-b9e57663ca85\" />\r\n\r\nThe [VideoLLaMA3](https://huggingface.co/papers/2501.13106) model is a major update to [VideoLLaMA2](https://huggingface.co/papers/2406.07476) from Alibaba DAMO Academy.\r\n\r\n* [model] Add VideoLLaMA3 implementation  by @lkhl in #40499\r\n\r\n### AudioFlamingo 3\r\n\r\n<img width=\"621\" height=\"475\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9616758-b3aa-41d0-bd58-695966ba146d\" />\r\n\r\nAudio Flamingo 3 (AF3) is a fully open large audio–language model designed for robust understanding and reasoning over speech, environmental sounds, and music. AF3 pairs a Whisper-style audio encoder with a causal language model and performs replace-in-place audio–text fusion: the processor aligns post-pool audio frames to a dedicated placeholder token and the model replaces those token slots with projected audio embeddings during the forward pass.\r\n\r\nThe model checkpoint is available at: [nvidia/audio-flamingo-3-hf](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/audio-flamingo-3-hf)\r\n\r\nHighlights:\r\n\r\n- Unified audio encoder across speech, sound, and music.\r\n- Long-audio support via windowing and post-pool alignment (up to 10 minutes maximum). The model processes audio in 30-second windows with a hard limit of 20 windows (10 minutes total). Audio longer than 10 minutes will be truncated.\r\n- Deterministic fusion that preserves sequence length by replacing audio placeholder tokens with audio embeddings.\r\n\r\n* [models] Add AudioFlamingo3 integration  by @lashahub in #40290\r\n\r\n### Nanochat\r\n\r\n[NanoChat](https://huggingface.co/karpathy/nanochat-d32) is a compact decoder-only transformer model designed for educational purposes and efficient training. The model features several fundamental architectural innovations which are common in modern transformer models.

This innovative model efficiently supports 109 languages and excels in recognizing complex elements (e.g., text, tables, formulas, and charts), while maintaining minimal resource consumption. Through comprehensive evaluations on widely used public benchmarks and in-house benchmarks, PaddleOCR-VL achieves SOTA performance in both page-level document parsing and element-level recognition. It significantly outperforms existing solutions, exhibits strong competitiveness against top-tier VLMs, and delivers fast inference speeds. These strengths make it highly suitable for practical deployment in real-world scenarios.\r\n\r\n* [Model] Add PaddleOCR-VL Model Support by @zhang-prog in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/42178\r\n\r\n### SAM: Perception Encoder Audiovisual\r\n\r\n<img width=\"719\" height=\"541\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fc5ee26-3c15-451f-bc7f-c779c2a78919\" />\r\n\r\nPE Audio (Perception Encoder Audio) is a state-of-the-art multimodal model that embeds audio and text into a shared (joint) embedding space.\r\nThe model enables cross-modal retrieval and understanding between audio and text.\r\n\r\n**Text input**\r\n- Produces a single embedding representing the full text.\r\n\r\n**Audio input**\r\n- **PeAudioFrameLevelModel**\r\n  - Produces a sequence of embeddings, one every 40 ms of audio.\r\n  - Suitable for audio event localization and fine-grained temporal analysis.\r\n- **PeAudioModel**\r\n  - Produces a single embedding for the entire audio clip.\r\n  - Suitable for global audio-text retrieval tasks.\r\n\r\n**The resulting embeddings can be used for:**\r\n- Audio event localization\r\n- Cross-modal (audio–text) retrieval and matching\r\n\r\n* Sam: Perception Encoder Audiovisual by @eustlb in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/42905\r\n\r\n### Jais2\r\n\r\n<img width=\"2100\" height=\"1154\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9343e81-903b-4445-ba0c-61c87830776a\" />\r\n\r\nJais2 a next-generation Arabic open-weight LLM trained on the richest Arabic-first dataset to date.

In this report, we share our key findings in the development of the reasoning-centric training framework. We first develop a capable vision foundation model with significant potential through large-scale pre-training, which arguably sets the upper bound for the final performance. We then propose Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Sampling (RLCS) to unlock the full potential of the model, leading to comprehensive capability enhancement across a diverse range of tasks, including STEM problem solving, video understanding, content recognition, coding, grounding, GUI-based agents, and long document interpretation. In a comprehensive evaluation across 42 public benchmarks, GLM-4.5V achieves state-of-the-art performance on nearly all tasks among open-source models of similar size, and demonstrates competitive or even superior results compared to closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Flash on challenging tasks including Coding and GUI Agents. Meanwhile, the smaller GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking remains highly competitive-achieving superior results to the much larger Qwen2.5-VL-72B on 29 benchmarks. We open-source both GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking and GLM-4.5V. We further introduce the GLM-4.6V series, open-source multimodal models with native tool use and a 128K context window.

It achieves a new state-of-the-art balance between speed (latency) and accuracy (mAP) by combining recent transformer advances with efficient design choices.\r\n\r\nThe LW-DETR architecture is characterized by its simple and efficient structure: a plain ViT Encoder, a Projector, and a shallow DETR Decoder. It enhances the DETR architecture for efficiency and speed using the following core modifications:\r\n\r\n    Efficient ViT Encoder: Uses a plain ViT with interleaved window/global attention and a window-major organization to drastically reduce attention complexity and latency.\r\n    Richer Input: Aggregates multi-level features from the encoder and uses a C2f Projector (YOLOv8) to pass two-scale features ( 1 / 8 and 1 / 32 ).\r\n    Faster Decoder: Employs a shallow 3-layer DETR decoder with deformable cross-attention for lower latency and faster convergence.\r\n    Optimized Queries: Uses a mixed-query scheme combining learnable content queries and generated spatial queries.\r\n\r\n* Add LWDetr model by @sbucaille in

      "content": "Hey HN! We&#x27;re Nithin and Nikhil, twin brothers building BrowserOS (YC S24). We&#x27;re an open-source, privacy-first alternative to the AI browsers from big labs.<p>The big differentiator: on BrowserOS you can use local LLMs or BYOK and run the agent entirely on the client side, so your company&#x2F;sensitive data stays on your machine!<p>Today we&#x27;re launching filesystem access... just like Claude Cowork, our browser agent can read files, write files, run shell commands! But honestly, we didn&#x27;t plan for this. It turns out the privacy decision we made 9 months ago accidentally positioned us for this moment.<p>The architectural bet we made 9 months ago: Unlike other AI browsers (ChatGPT Atlas, Perplexity Comet) where the agent loop runs server-side, we decided early on to run our agent entirely on your machine (client side).<p>But building everything on the client side wasn&#x27;t smooth. We initially built our agent loop inside a Chrome extension. But we kept hitting walls -- service worker being single thread JS; not having access to NodeJS libraries. So we made the hard decision 2 months ago to throw away everything and start from scratch.<p>In the new architecture, our agent loop sits in a standalone binary that we ship alongside our Chromium. And we use gemini-cli for the agent loop with some tweaks! We wrote a neat adapter to translate between Gemini format and Vercel AI SDK format. You can look at our entire codebase here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.new&#x2F;browseros-agent\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.new&#x2F;browseros-agent</a><p>How we give browser access to filesystem: When Claude Cowork launched, we realized something: because Atlas and Comet run their agent loop server-side, there&#x27;s no good way for their agent to access your files without uploading them to the server first. But our agent was already local. Adding filesystem access meant just... opening the door (with your permissions ofc). Our agent can now read and write files just like Claude Code.<p>What you can actually do today:<p>a) Organize files in my desktop folder <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;NOZ7xjto6Uc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;NOZ7xjto6Uc</a><p>b) Open top 5 HN links, extract the details and write summary into a HTML file <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;uXvqs_TCmMQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;uXvqs_TCmMQ</a><p>--- Where we are now\nIf you haven&#x27;t tried us since the last Show HN (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=44523409\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=44523409</a>), give us another shot. The new architecture unlocked a ton of new features, and we&#x27;ve grown to 8.5K GitHub stars and 100K+ downloads:<p>c) You can now build more reliable workflows using n8n-like graph <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;H_bFfWIevSY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;H_bFfWIevSY</a><p>d) You can also use BrowserOS as an MCP server in Cursor or Claude Code <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;5nevh00lckM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;5nevh00lckM</a><p>We are very bullish on browser being the right platform for a Claude Cowork like agent. Browser is the most commonly used app by knowledge workers (emails, docs, spreadsheets, research, etc). And even Anthropic recognizes this -- for Claude Cowork, they have janky integration with browser via a chrome extension. But owning the entire stack allows us to build differentiated features that wouldn&#x27;t be possible otherwise. Ex:  Browser ACLs.<p>Agents can do dumb or destructive things, so we&#x27;re adding browser-level guardrails (think IAM for agents): &quot;role(agent): can never click buy&quot; or &quot;role(agent): read-only access on my bank&#x27;s homepage.&quot;<p>Curious to hear your take on this and the overall thesis.<p>We’ll be in the comments.
