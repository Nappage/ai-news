      "content": "Hi HN,<p>Happy to share the project I&#x27;ve been vibe-coding on for past few months.\nThe Problem: Like many people, I often found myself staring at a fridge full of random ingredients (some about to expire) with no idea what to cook. I was tired of food waste and the repetitive cycle of making the same few meals. I wanted a way to creatively use what I already had.<p>The Solution: So, I decided to build Chefiniti. It&#x27;s an iOS app that acts as a personal AI chef. The core idea is to turn your available food into delicious, custom recipes. I know there are already tons of apps like it but this one is mine :)<p>Here&#x27;s what it can do:\n* Scan Ingredients: Take photos of your fridge or pantry, and the app&#x27;s vision model identifies the ingredients.\n* &quot;Recipefy&quot; a Dish: See a meal you like online or in a restaurant? Snap a photo, and the app generates a recipe to help you recreate it.\n* Generate from Prompt: Just describe what you&#x27;re in the mood for (e.g., &quot;a spicy, gluten-free pasta dish&quot;), and it will create a recipe from scratch.\n* Import from URL: Paste a link from a recipe website to import it into your cookbook.<p>You can also save all these recipes, create shopping lists, and set detailed preferences for diet, allergies, cuisine, and even the cookware you own.\nApp is in a freemium model, within limits you can really test out core features without any payment or even account creation.<p>The Tech Stack: For those interested, the app is built with:\n* Frontend: React Native (with Expo)\n* Backend: Firebase Functions for the API layer.\n* Database &amp; Storage: Firestore and Firebase Cloud Storage.\n* AI: Google&#x27;s Gemini API for recipe generation and analysis.\n* Image Generation: DeepInfra API (for Stable Diffusion).\n* Subscriptions: RevenueCat.<p>I&#x27;ve just launched on the App Store and would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, thoughts, or questions you might have.<p>You can check it out here: \n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chefiniti.app\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chefiniti.app</a>\nOr download directly\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;chefiniti-smart-recipe-creator&#x2F;id6745801080\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;chefiniti-smart-recipe-creator...</a>\nThanks for taking a look!",

Pressing twice within 3 seconds now kills all background agents.\n- Fixed prompt suggestion cache regression that reduced cache hit rates.\n- Fixed `plugin enable` and `plugin disable` to auto-detect the correct scope when `--scope` is not specified, instead of always defaulting to user scope\n- Simple mode (`CLAUDE_CODE_SIMPLE`) now includes the file edit tool in addition to the Bash tool, allowing direct file editing in simple mode.\n- Permission suggestions are now populated when safety checks trigger an ask response, enabling SDK consumers to display permission options\n- Sonnet 4.5 with 1M context is being removed from the Max plan in favor of our frontier Sonnet 4.6 model, which now has 1M context. Please switch in /model.\n- Fixed verbose mode not updating thinking block display when toggled via `/config` — memo comparators now correctly detect verbose changes\n- Fixed unbounded WASM memory growth during long sessions by periodically resetting the tree-sitter parser\n- Fixed potential rendering issues caused by stale yoga layout references\n- Improved performance in non-interactive mode (`-p`) by skipping unnecessary API calls during startup\n- Improved performance by caching authentication failures for HTTP and SSE MCP servers, avoiding repeated connection attempts to servers requiring auth\n- Fixed unbounded memory growth during long-running sessions caused by Yoga WASM linear memory never shrinking\n- SDK model info now includes `supportsEffort`, `supportedEffortLevels`, and `supportsAdaptiveThinking` fields so consumers can discover model capabilities.\n- Added `ConfigChange` hook event that fires when configuration files change during a session, enabling enterprise security auditing and optional blocking of settings changes.\n- Improved startup performance by caching MCP auth failures to avoid redundant connection attempts\n- Improved startup performance by reducing HTTP calls for analytics token counting\n- Improved startup performance by batching MCP tool token counting into a single API call\n- Fixed `disableAllHooks` setting to respect managed settings hierarchy — non-managed settings can no longer disable managed hooks set by policy (#26637)\n- Fixed `--resume` session picker showing raw XML tags for sessions that start with commands like `/clear`. Now correctly falls through to the session ID fallback.\n- Improved permission prompts for path safety and working directory blocks to show the reason for the restriction instead of a bare prompt with no context\n",

      "content": "## What's changed\n\n- Fixed FileWriteTool line counting to preserve intentional trailing blank lines instead of stripping them with `trimEnd()`.\n- Fixed Windows terminal rendering bugs caused by `os.EOL` (`\\r\\n`) in display code — line counts now show correct values instead of always showing 1 on Windows.\n- Improved VS Code plan preview: auto-updates as Claude iterates, enables commenting only when the plan is ready for review, and keeps the preview open when rejecting so Claude can revise.\n- Fixed a bug where bold and colored text in markdown output could shift to the wrong characters on Windows due to `\\r\\n` line endings.\n- Fixed compaction failing when conversation contains many PDF documents by stripping document blocks alongside images before sending to the compaction API (anthropics/claude-code#26188)\n- Improved memory usage in long-running sessions by releasing API stream buffers, agent context, and skill state after use\n- Improved startup performance by deferring SessionStart hook execution, reducing time-to-interactive by ~500ms.\n- Fixed an issue where bash tool output was silently discarded on Windows when using MSYS2 or Cygwin shells.\n- Improved performance of `@` file mentions - file suggestions now appear faster by pre-warming the index on startup and using session-based caching with background refresh.\n- Improved memory usage by trimming agent task message history after tasks complete\n- Improved memory usage during long agent sessions by eliminating O(n²) message accumulation in progress updates\n- Fixed the bash permission classifier to validate that returned match descriptions correspond to actual input rules, preventing hallucinated descriptions from incorrectly granting permissions\n- Fixed user-defined agents only loading one file on NFS/FUSE filesystems that report zero inodes (anthropics/claude-code#26044)\n- Fixed plugin agent skills silently failing to load when referenced by bare name instead of fully-qualified plugin name (anthropics/claude-code#25834)\n- Search patterns in collapsed tool results are now displayed in quotes for clarity\n- Windows: Fixed CWD tracking temp files never being cleaned up, causing them to accumulate indefinitely (anthropics/claude-code#17600)\n- Use `ctrl+f` to kill all background agents instead of double-pressing ESC. Background agents now continue running when you press ESC to cancel the main thread, giving you more control over agent lifecycle.\n- Fixed API 400 errors (\"thinking blocks cannot be modified\") that occurred in sessions with concurrent agents, caused by interleaved streaming content blocks preventing proper message merging.\n- Simplified teammate navigation to use only Shift+Down (with wrapping) instead of both Shift+Up and Shift+Down.\n- Fixed an issue where a single file write/edit error would abort all other parallel file write/edit operations. Independent file mutations now complete even when a sibling fails.\n- Added `last_assistant_message` field to Stop and SubagentStop hook inputs, providing the final assistant response text so hooks can access it without parsing transcript files.\n- Fixed custom session titles set via `/rename` being lost after resuming a conversation (anthropics/claude-code#23610)\n- Fixed collapsed read/search hint text overflowing on narrow terminals by truncating from the start.\n- Fixed an issue where bash commands with backslash-newline continuation lines (e.g., long commands split across multiple lines with `\\`) would produce spurious empty arguments, potentially breaking command execution.\n- Fixed built-in slash commands (`/help`, `/model`, `/compact`, etc.) being hidden from the autocomplete dropdown when many user skills are installed (anthropics/claude-code#22020)\n- Fixed MCP servers not appearing in the MCP Management Dialog after deferred loading\n- Fixed session name persisting in status bar after `/clear` command (anthropics/claude-code#26082)\n- Fixed crash when a skill's `name` or `description` in SKILL.md frontmatter is a bare number (e.g., `name: 3000`) — the value is now properly coerced to a string (anthropics/claude-code#25837)\n- Fixed /resume silently dropping sessions when the first message exceeds 16KB or uses array-format content (anthropics/claude-code#25721)\n- Added `chat:newline` keybinding action for configurable multi-line input (anthropics/claude-code#26075)\n- Added `added_dirs` to the statusline JSON `workspace` section, exposing directories added via `/add-dir` to external scripts (anthropics/claude-code#26096)\n- Fixed `claude doctor` misclassifying mise and asdf-managed installations as native installs (anthropics/claude-code#26033)\n- Fixed zsh heredoc failing with \"read-only file system\" error in sandboxed commands (anthropics/claude-code#25990)\n- Fixed agent progress indicator showing inflated tool use count (anthropics/claude-code#26023)\n- Fixed image pasting not working on WSL2 systems where Windows copies images as BMP format (anthropics/claude-code#25935)\n- Fixed background agent results returning raw transcript data instead of the agent's final answer (anthropics/claude-code#26012)\n- Fixed Warp terminal incorrectly prompting for Shift+Enter setup when it supports it natively (anthropics/claude-code#25957)\n- Fixed CJK wide characters causing misaligned timestamps and layout elements in the TUI (anthropics/claude-code#26084)\n- Fixed custom agent `model` field in `.claude/agents/*.md` being ignored when spawning team teammates (anthropics/claude-code#26064)\n- Fixed plan mode being lost after context compaction, causing the model to switch from planning to implementation mode (anthropics/claude-code#26061)\n- Fixed `alwaysThinkingEnabled: true` in settings.json not enabling thinking mode on Bedrock and Vertex providers (anthropics/claude-code#26074)\n- Fixed `tool_decision` OTel telemetry event not being emitted in headless/SDK mode (anthropics/claude-code#26059)\n- Fixed session name being lost after context compaction — renamed sessions now preserve their custom title through compaction (anthropics/claude-code#26121)\n- Increased initial session count in resume picker from 10 to 50 for faster session discovery (anthropics/claude-code#26123)\n- Windows: fixed worktree session matching when drive letter casing differs (anthropics/claude-code#26123)\n- Fixed `/resume <session-id>` failing to find sessions whose first message exceeds 16KB (anthropics/claude-code#25920)\n- Fixed \"Always allow\" on multiline bash commands creating invalid permission patterns that corrupt settings (anthropics/claude-code#25909)\n- Fixed React crash (error #31) when a skill's `argument-hint` in SKILL.md frontmatter uses YAML sequence syntax (e.g., `[topic: foo | bar]`) — the value is now properly coerced to a string (anthropics/claude-code#25826)\n- Fixed crash when using `/fork` on sessions that used web search — null entries in search results from transcript deserialization are now handled gracefully (anthropics/claude-code#25811)\n- Fixed read-only git commands triggering FSEvents file watcher loops on macOS by adding --no-optional-locks flag (anthropics/claude-code#25750)\n- Fixed custom agents and skills not being discovered when running from a git worktree — project-level `.claude/agents/` and `.claude/skills/` from the main repository are now included (anthropics/claude-code#25816)\n- Fixed non-interactive subcommands like `claude doctor` and `claude plugin validate` being blocked inside nested Claude sessions (anthropics/claude-code#25803)\n- Windows: Fixed the same CLAUDE.md file being loaded twice when drive letter casing differs between paths (anthropics/claude-code#25756)\n- Fixed inline code spans in markdown being incorrectly parsed as bash commands (anthropics/claude-code#25792)\n- Fixed teammate spinners not respecting custom spinnerVerbs from settings (anthropics/claude-code#25748)\n- Fixed shell commands permanently failing after a command deletes its own working directory (anthropics/claude-code#26136)\n- Fixed hooks (PreToolUse, PostToolUse) silently failing to execute on Windows by using Git Bash instead of cmd.exe (anthropics/claude-code#25981)\n- Fixed LSP `findReferences` and other location-based operations returning results from gitignored files (e.g., `node_modules/`, `venv/`) (anthropics/claude-code#26051)\n- Moved config backup files from home directory root to `~/.claude/backups/` to reduce home directory clutter (anthropics/claude-code#26130)\n- Fixed sessions with large first prompts (>16KB) disappearing from the /resume list (anthropics/claude-code#26140)\n- Fixed shell functions with double-underscore prefixes (e.g., `__git_ps1`) not being preserved across

appearing dimmed while the AskUserQuestion dialog is open (anthropics/claude-code#26078)\n- Fixed background tasks failing in git worktrees due to remote URL resolution reading from worktree-specific gitdir instead of the main repository config (anthropics/claude-code#26065)\n- Fixed Right Alt key leaving visible `[25~` escape sequence residue in the input field on Windows/Git Bash terminals (anthropics/claude-code#25943)\n- The `/rename` command now updates the terminal tab title by default (anthropics/claude-code#25789)\n- Fixed Edit tool silently corrupting Unicode curly quotes (\\u201c\\u201d \\u2018\\u2019) by replacing them with straight quotes when making edits (anthropics/claude-code#26141)\n- Fixed OSC 8 hyperlinks only being clickable on the first line when link text

Unlike the offline [Voxtral](./voxtral) model which processes complete audio files, VoxtralRealtime is architected for low-latency, incremental transcription by processing audio in chunks as they arrive.\r\n\r\nThe model combines an audio encoder with a Mistral-based language model decoder, using time conditioning embeddings and causal convolutions with padding caches to enable efficient streaming inference.\r\n\r\n* Add Voxtral Realtime (#43769) by @eustlb\r\n\r\n### GLM-5 - GlmMoeDsa\r\n\r\n<img width=\"947\" height=\"638\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c4fff37-7f40-4e86-b4a0-db718f45c93b\" />\r\n\r\nThe zAI team launches GLM-5, and introduces it as such:\r\n\r\n> GLM-5, targeting complex systems engineering and long-horizon agentic tasks. Scaling is still one of the most important ways to improve the intelligence efficiency of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Compared to GLM-4.5, GLM-5 scales from 355B parameters (32B active) to 744B parameters (40B active), and increases pre-training data from 23T to 28.5T tokens. GLM-5 also integrates DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA), largely reducing deployment cost while preserving long-context capacity.\r\n> \r\n> Reinforcement learning aims to bridge the gap between competence and excellence in pre-trained models. However, deploying it at scale for LLMs is a challenge due to the RL training inefficiency. To this end, we developed [slime](https://github.com/THUDM/slime), a novel asynchronous RL infrastructure that substantially improves training throughput and efficiency, enabling more fine-grained post-training iterations. With advances in both pre-training and post-training, GLM-5 delivers significant improvement compared to GLM-4.7 across a wide range of academic benchmarks and achieves best-in-class performance among all open-source models in the world on reasoning, coding, and agentic tasks, closing the gap with frontier models.\r\n\r\n* Add GlmMoeDsa (#43858) by @Cyrilvallez\r\n\r\n### Qwen3.5, Qwen3.5 Moe\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b56dcaca-80e7-4b22-80a5-2f767bb65095\" />\r\n\r\nThe Qwen team launches Qwen 3.5, and introduces it as such:\r\n\r\n> We are delighted to announce the official release of Qwen3.5, introducing the open-weight of the first model in the Qwen3.5 series, namely Qwen3.5-397B-A17B. As a native vision-language model, Qwen3.5-397B-A17B demonstrates outstanding results across a full range of benchmark evaluations, including reasoning, coding, agent capabilities, and multimodal understanding, empowering developers and enterprises to achieve significantly greater productivity. Built on an innovative hybrid architecture that fuses linear attention (via Gated Delta Networks) with a sparse mixture-of-experts, the model attains remarkable inference efficiency: although it comprises 397 billion total parameters, just 17 billion are activated per forward pass, optimizing both speed and cost without sacrificing capability. We have also expanded our language and dialect support from 119 to 201, providing broader accessibility and enhanced support to users around the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Adding Support for Qwen3.5 (#43830) by @bozheng-hit\r\n\r\n### VibeVoice Acoustic Tokenizer\r\n\r\n<img width=\"821\" height=\"349\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1433597-b43b-4d2d-a2c7-216d7792b8c9\" />\r\n\r\n[VibeVoice](https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.19205) is a novel framework for synthesizing high-fidelity, long-form speech with multiple speakers by employing a next-token diffusion approach within a Large Language Model (LLM) structure.

It introduces Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) loss and stable full-task reinforcement learning to improve training efficiency, recognition accuracy, and generalization. The model integrates the CogViT visual encoder pre-trained on large-scale image–text data, a lightweight cross-modal connector with efficient token downsampling, and a GLM-0.5B language decoder. Combined with a two-stage pipeline of layout analysis and parallel recognition based on PP-DocLayout-V3, GLM-OCR delivers robust and high-quality OCR performance across diverse document layouts.\r\n\r\n* [GLM-OCR] GLM-OCR Support (#43391)by @zRzRzRzRzRzRzR\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n\r\n* 🚨 T5Gemma2 model structure (#43633) - Makes sure that the attn implementation is set to all sub-configs. The config.encoder.text_config was not getting its attn set because we aren't passing it to PreTrainedModel.__init__. We can't change the model structure without breaking so I manually re-added a call to self.adjust_attn_implemetation in modeling code\r\n\r\n* 🚨 Generation cache preparation (#43679) - Refactors cache initialization in generation to ensure sliding window configurations are now properly respected. Previously, some models (like Afmoe) created caches without passing the model config, causing sliding window limits to be ignored. This is breaking because models with sliding window attention will now enforce their window size limits during generation, which may change generation behavior or require adjusting sequence lengths in existing code.\r\n\r\n* 🚨 Delete duplicate code in backbone utils (#43323) - This PR cleans up backbone utilities. Specifically, we have currently 5 different config attr to decide which backbone to load, most of which can be merged into one and seem redundant\r\nAfter this PR, we'll have only one config.backbone_config as a single source of truth.

      "content": "Hey HN! We&#x27;re Nithin and Nikhil, twin brothers building BrowserOS (YC S24). We&#x27;re an open-source, privacy-first alternative to the AI browsers from big labs.<p>The big differentiator: on BrowserOS you can use local LLMs or BYOK and run the agent entirely on the client side, so your company&#x2F;sensitive data stays on your machine!<p>Today we&#x27;re launching filesystem access... just like Claude Cowork, our browser agent can read files, write files, run shell commands! But honestly, we didn&#x27;t plan for this. It turns out the privacy decision we made 9 months ago accidentally positioned us for this moment.<p>The architectural bet we made 9 months ago: Unlike other AI browsers (ChatGPT Atlas, Perplexity Comet) where the agent loop runs server-side, we decided early on to run our agent entirely on your machine (client side).<p>But building everything on the client side wasn&#x27;t smooth. We initially built our agent loop inside a Chrome extension. But we kept hitting walls -- service worker being single thread JS; not having access to NodeJS libraries. So we made the hard decision 2 months ago to throw away everything and start from scratch.<p>In the new architecture, our agent loop sits in a standalone binary that we ship alongside our Chromium. And we use gemini-cli for the agent loop with some tweaks! We wrote a neat adapter to translate between Gemini format and Vercel AI SDK format. You can look at our entire codebase here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.new&#x2F;browseros-agent\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.new&#x2F;browseros-agent</a><p>How we give browser access to filesystem: When Claude Cowork launched, we realized something: because Atlas and Comet run their agent loop server-side, there&#x27;s no good way for their agent to access your files without uploading them to the server first. But our agent was already local. Adding filesystem access meant just... opening the door (with your permissions ofc). Our agent can now read and write files just like Claude Code.<p>What you can actually do today:<p>a) Organize files in my desktop folder <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;NOZ7xjto6Uc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;NOZ7xjto6Uc</a><p>b) Open top 5 HN links, extract the details and write summary into a HTML file <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;uXvqs_TCmMQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;uXvqs_TCmMQ</a><p>--- Where we are now\nIf you haven&#x27;t tried us since the last Show HN (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=44523409\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=44523409</a>), give us another shot. The new architecture unlocked a ton of new features, and we&#x27;ve grown to 8.5K GitHub stars and 100K+ downloads:<p>c) You can now build more reliable workflows using n8n-like graph <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;H_bFfWIevSY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;H_bFfWIevSY</a><p>d) You can also use BrowserOS as an MCP server in Cursor or Claude Code <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;5nevh00lckM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;5nevh00lckM</a><p>We are very bullish on browser being the right platform for a Claude Cowork like agent. Browser is the most commonly used app by knowledge workers (emails, docs, spreadsheets, research, etc). And even Anthropic recognizes this -- for Claude Cowork, they have janky integration with browser via a chrome extension. But owning the entire stack allows us to build differentiated features that wouldn&#x27;t be possible otherwise. Ex:  Browser ACLs.<p>Agents can do dumb or destructive things, so we&#x27;re adding browser-level guardrails (think IAM for agents): &quot;role(agent): can never click buy&quot; or &quot;role(agent): read-only access on my bank&#x27;s homepage.&quot;<p>Curious to hear your take on this and the overall thesis.<p>We’ll be in the comments.

But I didn&#x27;t build Solveig with a single kind of use case in mind.<p>---<p>So it&#x27;s yet another LLM-in-my-terminal?<p>Sort of. Solveig tries to do a few things that other tools don&#x27;t, and to do the shared features with clearer UX, explicit consent, and deeper configuration. It&#x27;s not an IDE extension, doesn&#x27;t require a GUI, and it&#x27;s not built for a specific user type or scenario.<p>At the same time, Solveig&#x27;s competitors are mature projects with real user testing that you should check out. I&#x27;ve written a detailed comparison (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FSilveiraa&#x2F;solveig&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;docs&#x2F;comparison.md\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FSilveiraa&#x2F;solveig&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;docs&#x2F;compari...</a>) to similar tools in the market in the docs.<p>---<p>UPCOMING<p>I have a Roadmap (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FSilveiraa&#x2F;solveig&#x2F;discussions&#x2F;2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FSilveiraa&#x2F;solveig&#x2F;discussions&#x2F;2</a>) available, and feel free to suggest new features or improvements. I&#x27;ve recently added user-defined system prompt templates, and now I&#x27;m working on adding token counting from API messages instead of relying on encoders.<p>---<p>A cool aspect of this project is that I can use Solveig to analyze and improve its own code itself, which also gives me a lot of exposure to its actual usability.<p>I appreciate any feedback or comment, especially anyone who can try out Solveig using Anthropic or Gemini APIs. Tell me if it helped you do something or what stopped you from using it properly in your specific case. Even if you can&#x27;t see how Solveig could help you let me know, that&#x27;s an issue with me communicating value that I need to fix.<p>Leaving a star on the repository (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FSilveiraa&#x2F;solveig\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FSilveiraa&#x2F;solveig</a>) is also very much appreciated.",
